MEDIUM - AuthProvider null profile handling:\n  ✅ Implemented with correction. Fixed by checking if (!profile) and calling supabase.auth.signOut() in both null case and catch block. Prevents \"logged-in but no profile\" zombie state for edge cases.\n\n  2. MEDIUM - authApi error mapping:\n  ✅ Implemented improvement. Enhanced to distinguish between authentication failures (status 400 or \"Invalid login credentials\") and server/network errors. Auth failures still show \"Invalid email or password\" for security (prevents account enumeration), while server errors now show \"Something went wrong. Please try again later.\" for better UX."}
