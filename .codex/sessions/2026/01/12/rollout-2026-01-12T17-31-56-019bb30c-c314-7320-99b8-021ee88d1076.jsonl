Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`#L432) - FIXED: Source files now show in git status after review fixes\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] `LoginForm` tests render without `AuthProvider`, so `useAuth()` throws. (`src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.tsx`#L28, `src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.test.tsx`#L24) - FIXED: Tests now wrap in AuthContext.Provider with mock value\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Deep imports bypass feature index exports (violates project rules). (`src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx`#L4, `src/pages/auth/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx`#L2, `src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`#L3, `src/router/index.tsx`#L11) - FIXED: All imports now use feature index exports\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] AC6 says redirect to `/judge`, but code redirects to `/judge/dashboard`. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`#L42, `src/router/AdminRoute.tsx`#L48) - FIXED: AdminRoute now redirects to /judge\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Uncommitted `.codex` changes not documented in File List. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`#L432) - RESOLVED: .codex files are not part of implementation artifacts\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] React namespace usage violates project rules in tests. (`src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.test.tsx`#L12) - FIXED: Changed React.ReactNode to import type { ReactNode }\n- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] AC2 requires exact error text; error message includes a trailing period. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`#L20, `src/lib/errorCodes.ts`#L35) - FIXED: Removed trailing period from error message\n- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Process Failure: Work Not Staged or Committed. Files created/modified but not `git add`ed. (All 24 files listed in \"File List\")\n- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] AC6: Judge Role Redirect (AC6) points to `/judge` instead of `/judge/dashboard`. (`src/router/AdminRoute.tsx`, Line 48)\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Architectural Flaw: Redundant `isLoading` State. `LoginForm.tsx` has local `isLoading` instead of using `useAuth`'s. (`src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.tsx`, Line 28)\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Architectural Flaw: Inconsistent API Exports in `authApi.ts`. Exports individual functions AND a bundled object. (`src/features/auth/api/authApi.ts`, Lines 28-135)\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Missing Requirement: Manual Tests Not Performed. Task 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 are unchecked. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`) - COMPLETED: All manual tests pass (2026-01-12)\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Missing Requirement: Error Codes Not Used. `authApi.ts` throws generic strings instead of `ERROR_CODES`. (`src/features/auth/api/authApi.ts`, Lines 40, 44, 57, 69, 83, 97)\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Missing File: `src/pages/judge/DashboardPage.tsx` Placeholder. File exists at `src/pages/judge/DashboardPage.tsx`.\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Inefficient Data Fetching. `AuthProvider.tsx` calls `fetchUserProfile` on `TOKEN_REFRESHED`. (`src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`, Line 61 - removed)\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Missing Exports in `index.ts` files. All exports verified complete in `src/features/auth/index.ts`, `src/pages/index.ts`, `src/contexts/index.ts`.\n- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Redundant `isAuthenticated` Memoization in `AuthProvider.tsx`. (`src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`, Line 102 - now computed inline)\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Story 2.1 scope includes admin layout, contests placeholder, and RLS migration not in Tasks/ACs. (`src/features/admin/components/AdminLayout.tsx`#L1) - RESOLVED: Story 2.2 (Admin Layout) was implemented during Story 2.1 code review iterations. All Story 2.2 work is completed, tested (9 tests pass), committed in this branch, and documented in 2-2-admin-layout-dashboard-shell.md. RLS migration (is_admin function) was necessary fix for AC5-AC7 to work correctly. \n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] React namespace usage in UI primitives violates project rules. (`src/components/ui/avatar.tsx`#L1) - RESOLVED: Added exception to project-context.md for shadcn/ui components. These are auto-generated by shadcn CLI and use their canonical React namespace style (9 files). Project rule applies to features/, pages/, contexts/, router/, lib/ only.\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Missing tests for auth state and route protection (AC5–AC7). (`src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`#L1) - RESOLVED: Created comprehensive test files (AuthProvider.test.tsx - 10 tests, AdminRoute.test.tsx - 5 tests, ProtectedRoute.test.tsx - 5 tests). All 56 project tests pass. Tests cover: initial state, signIn/signOut, session subscription, loading states, unauthenticated redirects (AC5), judge role redirects (AC6), admin access.\n- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] `ForgotPasswordPage` rethrows errors; no catch in form leads to unhandled rejection noise. (`src/pages/auth/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx`#L11) - RESOLVED: Added catch block in ForgotPasswordForm.tsx to handle rethrown errors gracefully. Form now properly prevents success state on error without unhandled rejection noise.\n- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] React namespace type usage remains in router tests (violates project rule). Possible fix: replace `React.ReactNode` with `type ReactNode` import from `react` and use `children: ReactNode` in both files. (`src/router/AdminRoute.test.tsx`#L33, `src/router/ProtectedRoute.test.tsx`#L33) - FIXED: Added `import { type ReactNode } from 'react'` and changed `children: React.ReactNode` to `children: ReactNode` in both test files\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] AC6 says redirect to `/judge`, but `/judge` immediately redirects to `/judge/dashboard`, so effective destination does not match AC text. Decide desired target and align AC or routing. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`#L45, `src/router/index.tsx`#L46) - RESOLVED: Updated AC6 text to say \"(/judge/dashboard)\" to accurately reflect the effective destination after routing\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] AC6 redirect mismatch between epic vs story vs router. Choose canonical target and align Epic 2 Story 2.1 text + router accordingly. (`_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics/epic-2-super-admin-authentication-contest-management.md`, `src/router/index.tsx`) - RESOLVED: Aligned to /judge/dashboard everywhere. Updated epic AC6, LoginPage.tsx redirects directly to /judge/dashboard, AdminRoute.tsx redirects to /judge/dashboard. Eliminates intermediate redirect for consistency with admin pattern.\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] AC7 (participant session redirect) not implemented; no participant session detection/guard in admin routes. Decide to implement in Story 2.1 or move AC7 to Epic 4 (participant session). (`src/router/AdminRoute.tsx`, `src/router/ProtectedRoute.tsx`) - RESOLVED: AC7 deferred to Epic 4. Participant sessions require ParticipantSessionContext (Epic 4). Cannot implement or test without contest/participant data. Current implementation already blocks unauthenticated users (AC5). AC7 marked as deferred in both story and epic.\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n\n### Database Already Set Up\n\nThe profiles table and auth trigger already exist from Epic 1 (Story 1-2):\n- `profiles` table with id, email, role ('admin' | 'judge'), first_name, last_name\n- Role protection trigger prevents users from changing their own role\n- New users default to 'judge' role (admin must be set manually in DB)\n\n**To create a Super Admin for testing:**\n```sql\n-- After signing up via Supabase Auth, update role to admin\nUPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';\n```\n\n### Auth Flow Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                        Auth Flow                                 │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  1.

Contact administrator\" text (no self-signup for admins)\n\n**ForgotPasswordForm.tsx:**\n- Email field only\n- Success message: \"Check your email for reset instructions\"\n- Link back to login\n\n**ResetPasswordPage.tsx:**\n- Handles Supabase password reset callback\n- New password + confirm password fields\n- Success redirects to login with toast\n\n### Protected Route Pattern\n\n```typescript\n// AdminRoute.tsx\nexport function AdminRoute({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const { user, isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();\n  const location = useLocation();\n\n  if (isLoading) {\n    return <LoadingScreen />;\n  }\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return <Navigate to=\"/login\" state={{ from: location }} replace />;\n  }\n\n  if (user?.role !== 'admin') {\n    // Judge trying to access admin routes\n    return <Navigate to=\"/judge\" replace />;\n  }\n\n  return <>{children}</>;\n}\n```\n\n### Route Configuration\n\n```typescript\n// router/index.tsx\nconst router = createBrowserRouter([\n  // Public routes\n  { path: '/login', element: <LoginPage /> },\n  { path: '/forgot-password', element: <ForgotPasswordPage /> },\n  { path: '/reset-password', element: <ResetPasswordPage /> },\n\n  // Admin routes (protected)\n  {\n    path: '/admin',\n    element: <AdminRoute><AdminLayout /></AdminRoute>,\n    children: [\n      { index: true, element: <Navigate to=\"/admin/dashboard\" replace /> },\n      { path: 'dashboard', element: <DashboardPage /> },\n      // More admin routes added in Story 2.2+\n    ],\n  },\n\n  // Judge routes (protected) - placeholder for Epic 3\n  {\n    path: '/judge',\n    element: <JudgeRoute><JudgeLayout /></JudgeRoute>,\n    children: [\n      { index: true, element: <Navigate to=\"/judge/dashboard\" replace /> },\n      { path: 'dashboard', element: <JudgeDashboardPlaceholder /> },\n    ],\n  },\n\n  // Default redirect\n  { path: '/', element: <Navigate to=\"/login\" replace /> },\n  { path: '*', element: <NotFoundPage /> },\n]);\n```\n\n### Styling Notes\n\n- Use shadcn/ui Card for login form container\n- Match Untitled UI neutral color scheme (already configured)\n- Responsive: mobile-first, max-width on form\n- Skeleton loading state while checking auth\n\n### Error Handling\n\nUse standardized error codes from `lib/errorCodes.ts`:\n```typescript\n// Add these error codes if not present\nexport const ERROR_CODES = {\n  // ... existing codes\n  AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS: 'AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS',\n  AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED: 'AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED',\n  AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED: 'AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED',\n} as const;\n```\n\n### Testing Notes\n\n**Unit Tests (LoginForm.test.tsx):**\n- Renders email and password fields\n- Shows validation errors for empty fields\n- Shows validation errors for invalid email format\n- Calls onSubmit with valid data\n- Disables submit button while loading\n\n**Manual Testing Checklist:**\n1. Create admin user in Supabase Dashboard\n2. Update role to 'admin' in profiles table\n3. Test login with correct credentials → redirects to /admin/dashboard\n4. Test login with wrong password → shows error toast\n5. Test login with non-existent email → shows error toast\n6. Test /admin/* access when logged out → redirects to /login\n7. Test password reset email is sent\n8. Test logout clears session and redirects\n\n### Previous Story Learnings Applied\n\nFrom Epic 1:\n- All imports from feature index, never deep paths\n- Named exports only, no default exports\n- Toast for user feedback: `toast.error()`, `toast.success()`\n- React Hook Form + Zod for all forms\n- TanStack Query for server state (not needed here - auth uses Supabase client directly)\n- Update index.ts immediately after creating new files\n- Update PROJECT_INDEX.md with new components\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n1. **Password hashing**: Handled by Supabase Auth (bcrypt)\n2. **Session tokens**: Stored in localStorage by Supabase (JWT)\n3. **Role enforcement**: RLS policies + frontend route guards\n4. **No role in JWT claims**: Always fetch from profiles table (prevents token manipulation)\n5. **HTTPS only**: Enforced by Vercel deployment\n\n### References\n\n- [Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#Authentication & Security]\n- [Source: prd/functional-requirements.md#FR1, FR4]\n- [Source: epic-2-super-admin-authentication-contest-management.md#Story 2.1]\n- [Source: ux-design/user-journey-flows.md#Flow 3: Admin Contest Creation]\n- [Source: project-context.md#Authentication Rules]\n- [Supabase Auth Docs: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth]\n- [React Router Protected Routes: https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial#authenticated-routes]\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\nN/A\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Implemented full auth context with Supabase integration (AuthContext, AuthProvider, useAuth hook)\n- Created LoginForm with React Hook Form + Zod validation (mode: 'onBlur' for inline validation)\n- Created ForgotPasswordForm and ResetPasswordPage for password recovery flow\n- Created ProtectedRoute, AdminRoute, JudgeRoute for role-based access control\n- AdminRoute redirects judges to /judge/dashboard, unauthenticated users to /login\n- Created placeholder admin and judge dashboard pages\n- Added auth error codes (AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS, AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED, AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED)\n- All unit tests pass (10 tests in LoginForm.test.tsx)\n- Build, lint, and type-check all pass\n- **CRITICAL FIX: RLS Policy Infinite Recursion** - Fixed \"Admins can read all profiles\" policy by creating `is_admin()` SECURITY DEFINER function to prevent recursive policy checks (Supabase migration required)\n- **ALL MANUAL TESTS PASS** (2026-01-12):\n  - ✓ 8.2: Login with valid admin credentials → redirects to /admin/dashboard\n  - ✓ 8.3: Invalid credentials show error toast\n  - ✓ 8.4: Password reset flow sends email successfully\n  - ✓ 8.5: Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to /login\n- **CODE REVIEW FIXES APPLIED** (2026-01-12):\n  - ✓ Fixed LoginForm.test.tsx to wrap tests in AuthContext.Provider mock\n  - ✓ Fixed React namespace usage (React.ReactNode → import type { ReactNode })\n  - ✓ Fixed deep imports across 4 files (LoginPage, ForgotPasswordPage, AuthProvider, router/index)\n  - ✓ Fixed AC6 redirect from /judge/dashboard to /judge in AdminRoute.tsx\n  - ✓ Fixed AC2 error text - removed trailing period from \"Invalid email or password\"\n- **SECOND CODE REVIEW FOLLOW-UPS RESOLVED** (2026-01-12):\n  - ✓ Item 1 [HIGH]: Documented Story 2.2 scope expansion in Story 2.1 (AdminLayout implemented during review iterations)\n  - ✓ Item 2 [MEDIUM]: Added shadcn/ui exception to project-context.md for React namespace imports (9 auto-generated files)\n  - ✓ Item 3 [MEDIUM]: Created comprehensive route protection tests (20 new tests: AuthProvider, AdminRoute, ProtectedRoute)\n  - ✓ Item 4 [LOW]: Fixed error handling in ForgotPasswordForm to prevent unhandled rejection noise\n  - ✓ All 56 tests pass (10 LoginForm + 10 AuthProvider + 5 AdminRoute + 5 ProtectedRoute + 9 AdminSidebar + 17 examples)\n- **THIRD CODE REVIEW FOLLOW-UPS RESOLVED** (2026-01-12):\n  - ✓ Item 1 [CRITICAL]: Fixed React namespace usage in router tests (AdminRoute.test.tsx, ProtectedRoute.test.tsx) - Changed `React.ReactNode` to `import { type ReactNode } from 'react'` and `children: ReactNode`\n  - ✓ Item 2 [MEDIUM]: Updated AC6 to say \"(/judge/dashboard)\" instead of \"(/judge)\" to accurately reflect effective destination after routing\n  - ✓ All 56 tests still pass after fixes\n- **FOURTH CODE REVIEW FOLLOW-UPS RESOLVED** (2026-01-12):\n  - ✓ Item 1 [MEDIUM]: AC6 redirect alignment - Updated epic, LoginPage.tsx, and AdminRoute.tsx to consistently use /judge/dashboard (eliminates intermediate redirect, matches admin pattern)\n  - ✓ Item 2 [HIGH]: AC7 deferred to Epic 4 - Participant session detection requires ParticipantSessionContext from Epic 4. Cannot implement/test without contest/participant data. AC7 marked as deferred in both story and epic files. Tasks updated to reflect AC: 1-6 instead of 1-7.\n\n### Change Log\n\n| Date | Change | Files |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| 2026-01-12 | Implemented Story 2.1 Super Admin Login | See File List below |\n\n### File List\n\n**New Files:**\n- src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx\n- src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx\n- src/contexts/AuthProvider.test.tsx\n- src/features/auth/api/authApi.ts\n- src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.tsx\n- src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.test.tsx\n- src/features/auth/components/ForgotPasswordForm.tsx\n- src/features/auth/types/auth.types.ts\n- src/features/auth/types/auth.schemas.ts\n- src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx\n- src/pages/auth/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx\n- src/pages/auth/ResetPasswordPage.tsx\n- src/pages/admin/DashboardPage.tsx\n- src/pages/judge/DashboardPage.tsx\n- src/router/ProtectedRoute.tsx\n- src/router/ProtectedRoute.test.tsx\n- src/router/AdminRoute.tsx\n- src/router/AdminRoute.test.tsx\n- src/router/JudgeRoute.tsx\n\n**Modified Files:**\n- PROJECT_INDEX.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\n- src/contexts/index.ts\n- src/features/auth/index.ts\n- src/features/auth/components/ForgotPasswordForm.tsx\n- src/lib/errorCodes.ts\n- src/main.tsx\n- src/pages/index.ts\n- src/router/index.tsx\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read this FIRST before any implementation work._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n| Category | Technology | Version |\n|----------|------------|---------|\n| Framework | React | 19 |\n| Build | Vite | 6+ |\n| Language | TypeScript | Strict mode |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS | v4 |\n| Components | shadcn/ui | Latest |\n| Backend | Supabase | Auth + PostgreSQL + Edge Functions |\n| Server State | TanStack Query | Latest |\n| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod | Latest |\n| Routing | React Router DOM | v6+ |\n| Monitoring | Sentry | Latest |\n\n**External Services:**\n- Bunny Stream (video storage/streaming)\n- Bunny Storage (photos/assets)\n- Brevo (transactional email)\n\n---\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Feature Architecture (MOST IMPORTANT)\n\n**Mandatory Index Files:**\n```typescript\n// Every feature folder MUST have index.ts exporting ALL contents\n// features/submissions/index.ts\n\n// === Components ===\nexport { UploadProgress } from './components/UploadProgress';\nexport { SubmissionCard } from './components/SubmissionCard';\n\n// === Hooks ===\nexport { useSubmissions } from './hooks/useSubmissions';\n\n// === API ===\nexport { submissionsApi } from './api/submissionsApi';\n\n// === Types ===\nexport type { Submission, SubmissionStatus } from './types/submission.types';\n```\n\n**Import Rules:**\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Always import from feature index\nimport { UploadProgress, useSubmissions } from '@/features/submissions';\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Never import from deep paths\nimport { UploadProgress } from '@/features/submissions/components/UploadProgress';\n```\n\n**After Creating Any New File:**\n1. Add export to the feature's `index.ts` immediately\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding new features or major components\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\n| Context | Convention | Example |\n|---------|------------|---------|\n| Database tables | snake_case, plural | `participants`, `contest_codes` |\n| Database columns | snake_case | `created_at`, `contest_id` |\n| TypeScript files | PascalCase (components), camelCase (utils) | `RatingScale.tsx`, `submissionsApi.ts` |\n| Functions/variables | camelCase | `getContests`, `isLoading` |\n| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE | `MAX_FILE_SIZE` |\n| Types/Interfaces | PascalCase | `Contest`, `SubmissionStatus` |\n| Hooks | use + PascalCase | `useContests`, `useFileUpload` |\n\n**Data Transformation:**\n- Database returns `snake_case` → Transform to `camelCase` in API layer\n- Never mix conventions within same layer\n\n### State Management Rules\n\n| State Type | Solution | Location |\n|------------|----------|----------|\n| Server data | TanStack Query | Feature hooks |\n| Form data | React Hook Form | Component-local |\n| Auth state | React Context | `AuthContext` |\n| Participant session | React Context | `ParticipantSessionContext` |\n| Local UI | useState | Component-local |\n\n**Never:**\n- Use useState for server data (use TanStack Query)\n- Create global state for form data\n- Mix state management solutions for same concern\n\n### Authentication Rules\n\n**Three Separate Auth Flows:**\n\n| Role | Method | Implementation |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| Admin | Email + Password | Supabase Auth |\n| Judge | Email + Password | Supabase Auth (invite flow) |\n| Participant | Contest Code + Participant Code | localStorage (NO Supabase account) |\n\n**Participant Session:**\n- Store codes in localStorage with `last_activity` timestamp\n- Expire after **120 minutes** of inactivity\n- Active upload keeps session alive\n- Clear on logout (shared device reminder)\n\n### Supabase Security Rules (MANDATORY)\n\n**Signup Triggers:**\n- ALWAYS force default role ('judge') in signup triggers\n- NEVER trust user metadata for role assignment (prevents privilege escalation)\n- ALWAYS use `SET search_path = public` in SECURITY DEFINER functions\n\n```sql\n-- CORRECT: Force role, ignore metadata\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()\nRETURNS TRIGGER\nSET search_path = public  -- Prevents search_path hijacking\nAS $$\nBEGIN\n  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email, role)\n  VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.email, 'judge');  -- Always 'judge', never from metadata\n  RETURN NEW;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;\n```\n\n**RLS Policies:**\n- ALWAYS enable RLS on tables with user data\n- NEVER allow users to modify their own role or email via RLS UPDATE policies\n- Use trigger-based column protection for sensitive fields\n\n**Column Protection Pattern:**\n```sql\n-- Trigger to prevent role/email modification\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION protect_sensitive_columns()\nRETURNS TRIGGER AS $$\nBEGIN\n  IF OLD.role IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.role THEN\n    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Cannot modify role column';\n  END IF;\n  IF OLD.email IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.email THEN\n    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Cannot modify email column';\n  END IF;\n  RETURN NEW;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\nCREATE TRIGGER protect_profile_columns\n  BEFORE UPDATE ON profiles\n  FOR EACH ROW\n  EXECUTE FUNCTION protect_sensitive_columns();\n```\n\n**TypeScript Types Must Match:**\n```typescript\n// Exclude protected columns from Update type\nUpdate: {\n  first_name?: string | null;\n  last_name?: string | null;\n  // NO role, NO email, NO id\n};\n```\n\n### Bunny Upload Security (CRITICAL)\n\n**Never expose Bunny credentials to client.**\n\n**Upload Flow:**\n1. Client requests signed URL from Edge Function\n2. Edge Function validates: participant codes, category open, within limits\n3. Edge Function returns short-lived signed URL\n4. Client uploads directly to Bunny using signed URL\n\n**Storage Path Pattern:**\n```\n/{contest_id}/{category_id}/{participant_code}/{filename}\n```\n\n### Anonymous Judging Rules\n\n**Judge queries must NEVER access participant PII.**\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Judge view query\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('id, media_url, participant_id')  // participant_id is UUID, not PII\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Joins to participant data\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('*, participants(name, organization)')  // EXPOSES PII\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\n**Use Standardized Error Codes:**\n```typescript\nimport { ERROR_CODES } from '@/lib/errorCodes';\n\n// Always use predefined codes\nthrow new AppError(ERROR_CODES.CATEGORY_CLOSED, 'Category deadline has passed');\n```\n\n**Error Codes Available:**\n- `INVALID_CODES`, `SESSION_EXPIRED`, `CONTEST_NOT_FOUND`\n- `CATEGORY_CLOSED`, `SUBMISSION_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`\n- `FILE_TOO_LARGE`, `INVALID_FILE_TYPE`\n- `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `SERVER_ERROR`\n\n### React Import Standards\n\n**Always use explicit imports, never React namespace:**\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Explicit type imports\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { type ComponentProps, type HTMLAttributes } from 'react';\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Don't use React namespace\nimport React from 'react';\nconst props: React.ComponentProps<typeof Button>;  // Don't do this\n```\n\n**Type-only imports for types:**\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Use 'type' keyword for type-only imports\nimport { type ReactNode, type FC } from 'react';\n\n// Also acceptable\nimport type { ReactNode, FC } from 'react';\n```\n\n**Exception for shadcn/ui Components:**\n```typescript\n// ✅ ACCEPTABLE - shadcn/ui components in src/components/ui/ use their canonical style\n// These are auto-generated by shadcn CLI and use React namespace imports\n// Example: src/components/ui/avatar.tsx, button.tsx, etc.\nimport * as React from \"react\"\nconst Component = React.forwardRef<React.ElementRef<...>, React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<...>>()\n\n// Project rule applies to: features/, pages/, contexts/, router/, lib/ (NOT src/components/ui/)\n```\n\n### Component Structure\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Imports (React first, then external, then internal)\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { type ComponentProps } from 'react';\nimport { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui';\nimport { useContests } from '@/features/contests';\n\n// 2. Types (interface for props)\ninterface ContestCardProps {\n  contest: Contest;\n  onSelect: (id: string) => void;\n}\n\n// 3. Component (named export, not default)\nexport function ContestCard({ contest, onSelect }: ContestCardProps) {\n  // hooks first\n  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);\n\n  // handlers\n  const handleClick = () => onSelect(contest.id);\n\n  // render\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n**Co-locate tests with source:**\n```\nfeatures/submissions/components/\n├── UploadProgress.tsx\n├── UploadProgress.test.tsx  ← Same folder\n```\n\n**Test Naming:**\n- Unit tests: `{ComponentName}.test.tsx`\n- Integration tests: `{feature}.integration.test.ts`\n\n### Zod Schema Rules\n\n**Single Source of Truth:**\n```typescript\n// Define schema in types/ folder\n// features/contests/types/contest.schemas.ts\nexport const contestFormSchema = z.object({\n  name: z.string().min(1, 'Required'),\n  contestCode: z.string().length(6, 'Must be 6 digits'),\n});\n\n// Use in form AND API validation\n```\n\n### Git Workflow Rules (MANDATORY - ENFORCED BY WORKFLOWS)\n\n**🔥 CRITICAL: Branch discipline is now ENFORCED by dev-story and code-review workflows 🔥**\n\n**Branch-Per-Story (Parallel Development):**\n\nEach story MUST have its own dedicated branch. Multiple stories can be in progress simultaneously on separate branches.\n\n**Branch Naming Convention (EXACT MATCH REQUIRED):**\n```bash\nstory/{story-key}\n\n# The branch name MUST exactly match the story filename (without .md extension)\n# Examples:\nstory/1-4-core-ui-components  # for file: 1-4-core-ui-components.md\nstory/1-5-ci-cd-config        # for file: 1-5-ci-cd-config.md\nstory/2-1-super-admin-login   # for file: 2-1-super-admin-login.md\n```\n\n**Automatic Enforcement:**\n\n**When dev-story workflow runs:**\n1. **Checks if branch `story/{story-key}` exists**\n2. **If exists:** Checks out the branch and continues\n3. **If not exists:** Creates branch from main, checks out, and continues\n4. **Validates:** Confirms you're on correct branch before any code changes\n5. **Before marking \"review\":** Ensures all changes committed and branch pushed to remote\n\n**When code-review workflow runs:**\n1. **REQUIRES branch `story/{story-key}` to exist** - HALTS if missing\n2. **Checks out the story branch** to review actual changes\n3. **After approval (status=done):** Offers to merge branch automatically or create PR\n4. **Commits any review fixes** made during review to the story branch\n\n**Starting a New Story:**\n```bash\n# Dev workflow handles this automatically - no manual branch creation needed!\n# Just run: /dev-story\n\n# Workflow will:\n# - Detect no branch exists for story\n# - Create story/{story-key} from main\n# - Checkout the branch\n# - Begin implementation\n```\n\n**Switching Between Stories:**\n```bash\n# Commit current work before switching\ngit add -A && git commit -m \"{story-id}: WIP - {brief description}\"\ngit checkout story/{other-story-id}\n\n# Or let dev-story handle it - it will checkout correct branch automatically\n```\n\n**Commit Message Format (Auto-Generated by Dev):**\n\nThe Dev agent MUST auto-generate descriptive commit messages following this format:\n\n```\n{story-id}: {action} {what changed}\n\nActions: Add, Update, Fix, Refactor, Remove, Configure, Implement\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n- `1-4: Add Button and Card components`\n- `1-4: Update index.ts with new exports`\n- `1-4: Fix TypeScript errors in form validation`\n- `1-5: Configure Vite environment variables`\n- `2-1: Implement login form with Supabase auth`\n\n**Before Marking Story as \"review\" Status:**\n\n1. Switch to the story's branch\n2. ALL changes for that story must be committed\n3. Branch must be pushed to remote\n4. Working tree must be clean (`git status` shows nothing to commit)\n\n**Pre-Review Checklist (MANDATORY):**\n\nBefore marking any story as \"review\" status, verify ALL items:\n\n```bash\n# Git Status (REQUIRED)\n□ git status          # Must show: \"nothing to commit, working tree clean\"\n□ git log --oneline -5  # Verify commits have story ID prefix\n□ git push -u origin story/{story-id}-{description}  # Push to remote\n\n# Quality Gates (REQUIRED)\n□ npm run build       # Must pass with no errors\n□ npm run lint        # Must pass with no errors\n□ npm run type-check  # Must pass with no errors\n□ npm run test        # Must pass (if tests exist for story)\n\n# Import Compliance (REQUIRED)\n□ grep -r \"from '@/\" src/ | grep -v \"/index'\" | grep -v \"from '@/lib'\" | grep -v \"from '@/components/ui'\"\n  # Should return empty - no deep imports allowed\n\n# Documentation (REQUIRED)\n□ All Acceptance Criteria verified with evidence (test output, screenshots, logs)\n□ File List in story generated from git (see File List Generation below)\n□ Dev Notes updated with any new patterns discovered\n```\n\n**File List Generation (MANDATORY):**\n\nNEVER manually write the File List. Always generate from git:\n\n```bash\n# Run these commands and copy output to story File List section:\n\necho \"**New Files:**\"\ngit status --porcelain | grep \"^??\" | cut -c4- | sed 's/^/- /'\n\necho \"**Modified Files:**\"\ngit status --porcelain | grep \"^ M\\|^M \" | cut -c4- | sed 's/^/- /'\n\necho \"**Deleted Files:**\"\ngit status --porcelain | grep \"^ D\\|^D \" | cut -c4- | sed 's/^/- /'\n```\n\n**Code Review Will Be REJECTED If:**\n- ❌ Story changes are not on a dedicated story branch → **NOW ENFORCED:** code-review HALTS if branch doesn't exist\n- ❌ Uncommitted changes exist on the story branch → **NOW ENFORCED:** dev-story validates before marking \"review\"\n- ❌ Branch is not pushed to remote → **NOW ENFORCED:** dev-story auto-pushes before marking \"review\"\n- ❌ Commit messages don't follow the `{story-id}: {action} {what}` format → Reviewers will flag this\n\n**Branch Enforcement Summary:**\n- ✅ **dev-story workflow:** Automatically creates/checks out correct branch, validates before marking \"review\"\n- ✅ **code-review workflow:** Validates branch exists before review, offers auto-merge after approval\n- ✅ **Parallel development:** Multiple stories can safely run simultaneously on separate branches\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)\n\n1. **Never import from deep paths** — Always use feature index\n2. **Never use useState for server data** — Use TanStack Query\n3. **Never expose Bunny credentials to client** — Use Edge Functions\n4. **Never join participant PII in judge queries** — Anonymous judging\n5. **Never skip index.ts updates** — Every export must be indexed\n6. **Never mix naming conventions** — snake_case DB, camelCase code\n7. **Never store participant passwords** — Code-only access\n8. **Never use default exports** — Named exports only\n9. **Never trust user metadata for role assignment** — Force default role in triggers\n10. **Never manually write File Lists** — Generate from git status\n11. **Never use React namespace (React.ComponentProps)** — Use explicit imports\n12. **Never skip pre-review checklist** — All gates must pass before review\n13. **Never work on wrong branch** — Workflows enforce story/{story-key} branching (auto-created if missing)\n14. **Never mark story \"review\" with uncommitted changes** — Workflow validates and auto-pushes\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n**Before implementing any feature:**\n1. Read `PROJECT_INDEX.md` at project root\n2. Read the feature's `index.ts` to understand existing exports\n3. Check this file (project-context.md) for patterns and rules\n\n**After implementing:**\n1. Update feature's `index.ts` with new exports\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding major components\n3.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

\"submission_id\": \"uuid\", \"tier\": \"advanced_producer\" }\n]\n```\n- Index = Rank (0 = 1st place, 1 = 2nd place, etc.)\n- Top 3 indices = Winners displayed on winners page\n- Constraint: Lower-tier submissions cannot rank above higher-tier submissions\n\n**Rating Tiers:**\n\n| Tier | Rating Range |\n|------|--------------|\n| Developing Skills | 1-2 |\n| Emerging Producer | 3-4 |\n| Proficient Creator | 5-6 |\n| Advanced Producer | 7-8 |\n| Master Creator | 9-10 |\n\n## Authentication & Security\n\n**Auth Flows by Role:**\n\n| Role | Method | Implementation |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| Super Admin | Email + Password | Supabase Auth standard login |\n| Judge | Email + Password | Supabase invite → set password on first visit |\n| Participant | Contest Code + Participant Code | Stateless, localStorage, no Supabase account |\n\n**Participant Session Security:**\n- Codes stored in localStorage with `last_activity` timestamp\n- Session expires after **120 minutes** of inactivity\n- Active upload keeps session alive\n- Logout button with reminder for shared devices\n\n**Bunny Upload Security (CRITICAL):**\n- No direct public Bunny endpoints\n- Signed upload URLs generated server-side via Edge Function\n- Validation before URL generation: valid codes, category open, within limits\n- Storage isolation: `/{contest_id}/{category_id}/{participant_code}/{file}`\n- Rate limiting per participant per contest\n\n## API Patterns\n\n| Operation | Approach | Reason |\n|-----------|----------|--------|\n| Read/write contests, categories, submissions | Supabase Client + RLS | Simple CRUD, RLS enforces access |\n| Generate Bunny signed URLs | Edge Function | Secret keys, validation logic |\n| Send email notifications | Edge Function | Brevo API keys, async |\n| Validate participant codes | Edge Function | Rate limiting, session token |\n\n**Row Level Security (RLS):**\n- Admin: Full access to all tables\n- Judge: Read assigned categories + submissions, write reviews/rankings\n- Participant (via Edge Function): Own submissions only\n\n## Frontend Architecture\n\n**State Management:**\n\n| State Type | Solution |\n|------------|----------|\n| Server state | TanStack Query |\n| UI state | React Context |\n| Form state | React Hook Form + Zod |\n\n**Folder Structure: Bulletproof React**\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── features/\n│   ├── auth/\n│   │   ├── api/\n│   │   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── types/\n│   │   └── index.ts          # REQUIRED\n│   ├── contests/\n│

only\n```\n\n**Coding Guideline: Feature Index Files**\n\nEvery feature folder MUST have an `index.ts` that exports its public API.\n\n```typescript\n// features/reviews/index.ts\nexport { RatingScale } from './components/RatingScale';\nexport { useReviews, useSubmitReview } from './hooks/useReviews';\nexport { reviewsApi } from './api/reviewsApi';\nexport type { Review, Rating, Tier } from './types/review.types';\n```\n\n**Import Rule:**\n```typescript\n// ✅ Good\nimport { RatingScale, useReviews } from '@/features/reviews';\n\n// ❌ Bad\nimport { RatingScale } from '@/features/reviews/components/RatingScale';\n```\n\n**For AI Agents:** When exploring or modifying a feature:\n1. FIRST read `features/{feature}/index.ts`\n2. Understand available exports before diving into subfolders\n3. When adding new exports, UPDATE the index.ts\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n**Environments:**\n\n| Environment | Supabase Project | Purpose |\n|-------------|------------------|---------|\n| development | Separate project | Local dev, safe to reset |\n| preview | Production project | PR preview deployments |\n| production | Production project | Live site |\n\n**Environment Variables:**\n\n| Service | Variables |\n|---------|-----------|\n| Supabase | `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` |\n| Bunny Storage | `BUNNY_STORAGE_API_KEY`, `BUNNY_STORAGE_ZONE` |\n| Bunny Stream | `BUNNY_STREAM_API_KEY`, `BUNNY_STREAM_LIBRARY_ID` |\n| Brevo | `BREVO_API_KEY` |\n| Sentry | `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` |\n\n**CI/CD Pipeline:**\n\n| Trigger | Action |\n|---------|--------|\n| Push to `main` | Deploy to production (Vercel) |\n| Push to PR branch | Deploy preview (Vercel) |\n| PR opened | Run lint, type-check, tests (GitHub Actions) |\n\n**Monitoring:**\n\n| Need | Solution |\n|------|----------|\n| Error tracking | Sentry (free tier) |\n| Analytics | Vercel Analytics |\n| Logs | Vercel + Supabase dashboards |\n\n## Updated Initialization Sequence\n\n```bash\n# 1. Create Vite project\nnpm create vite@latest media-education-solutions -- --template react-ts\ncd media-education-solutions\n\n# 2. Install Tailwind\nnpm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite\n\n# 3. Install shadcn/ui\nnpx shadcn@latest init\n\n# 4. Add Supabase\nnpm install @supabase/supabase-js\n\n# 5. Add form handling + data fetching\nnpm install react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers zod @tanstack/react-query\n\n# 6. Add routing\nnpm install react-router-dom\n\n# 7. Add error tracking\nnpm install @sentry/react\n```\n# Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n## Naming Patterns\n\n**Database:**\n- Tables: snake_case, plural (`contests`, `participants`)\n- Columns: snake_case (`contest_id`, `created_at`)\n- Foreign keys: `{table}_id`\n- Indexes: `idx_{table}_{column}`\n\n**Code:**\n- Components: PascalCase (`RatingScale.tsx`)\n- Functions/variables: camelCase (`getContests`, `isLoading`)\n- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE (`MAX_FILE_SIZE`)\n- Types: PascalCase (`Contest`, `SubmissionStatus`)\n- Hooks: `use` + PascalCase (`useContests`)\n\n## Format Patterns\n\n**API Responses:**\n```typescript\n{ data: T | null, error: { message: string, code: string } | null }\n```\n\n**JSON Fields:**\n- Database/API: snake_case\n- Frontend state: camelCase (transform on fetch)\n\n**Dates:**\n- Storage: TIMESTAMPTZ\n- API: ISO 8601 (`2026-01-10T14:30:00Z`)\n- Display: `Intl.DateTimeFormat`\n\n## Error Handling Patterns\n\n**Standardized Error Codes:**\n```typescript\n// lib/errorCodes.ts\nexport const ERROR_CODES = {\n  INVALID_CODES: 'INVALID_CODES',\n  SESSION_EXPIRED: 'SESSION_EXPIRED',\n  CONTEST_NOT_FOUND: 'CONTEST_NOT_FOUND',\n  CATEGORY_CLOSED: 'CATEGORY_CLOSED',\n  SUBMISSION_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: 'SUBMISSION_LIMIT_EXCEEDED',\n  FILE_TOO_LARGE: 'FILE_TOO_LARGE',\n  INVALID_FILE_TYPE: 'INVALID_FILE_TYPE',\n  VALIDATION_ERROR: 'VALIDATION_ERROR',\n  SERVER_ERROR: 'SERVER_ERROR',\n} as const;\n```\n\n**Frontend Error Handling:**\n- TanStack Query error states for server errors\n- Sentry logging for all errors\n- User-friendly toast messages\n\n## Loading State Patterns\n\n| State | Meaning | UI Pattern |\n|-------|---------|------------|\n| `isLoading` | Initial fetch | Skeleton |\n| `isFetching` | Refetch | Subtle indicator |\n| `isSubmitting` | Form submit | Button spinner |\n| `isUploading` | File upload | Progress bar |\n\n## State Management Patterns\n\n| State Type | Solution |\n|------------|----------|\n| Server data | TanStack Query |\n| Form data | React Hook Form |\n| Local UI | useState |\n| Shared UI | React Context (one per concern) |\n\n## Validation Patterns\n\n- Zod schemas as single source of truth in `types/` folder\n- Validate on blur (field) + submit (form) + server (Edge Function)\n\n## File Patterns\n\n- Tests co-located: `RatingScale.test.tsx` next to `RatingScale.tsx`\n- Components: Named exports, props interface above component, hooks first\n\n## Component File Structure\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Imports\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\n// 2. Types\ninterface ComponentProps {\n  value: string;\n  onChange: (value: string) => void;\n}\n\n// 3. Component (named export)\nexport function Component({ value, onChange }: ComponentProps) {\n  // hooks first\n  const [state, setState] = useState();\n\n  // handlers\n  const handleChange = () => {};\n\n  // render\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n```\n\n## Enforcement: All AI Agents MUST\n\n1. Follow naming conventions exactly (snake_case DB, camelCase code, PascalCase components)\n2. Import from feature index, not deep paths\n3. Use standardized error codes from `lib/errorCodes.ts`\n4. Use TanStack Query for all server state\n5. Define Zod schemas for all forms\n6. Co-locate tests with source files\n7. Use named exports for components\n8. Update `index.ts` when adding new exports to a feature\n# Architecture Decision Document\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Architecture Decision Document]…1522 tokens truncated…ng | Separate data models for judge view vs admin view |\n| Security | Password-protected winners | Client-side gate, data fetched only after auth |\n| Scalability | 5+ concurrent contests | Multi-tenant data model, efficient queries |\n| Scalability | 200-500 participants/contest | Bunny handles storage scale, Supabase handles metadata |\n| Reliability | 99.5% upload success | Resumable uploads, retry logic, clear error states |\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\n\n- Primary domain: Full-stack web application (React SPA + Supabase BaaS)\n- Complexity level: Medium-High\n- Estimated architectural components: ~15-20 (auth, contests, categories, codes, submissions, reviews, rankings, notifications, file handling, etc.)\n\n## Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n**Fixed Technology Choices (from PRD):**\n- Frontend: React + Vite (SPA, no SSR needed)\n- Backend: Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL, Edge Functions if needed)\n- Video: Bunny Stream (storage, transcoding, streaming)\n- Photos/Assets: Bunny Storage (all files per architectural decision)\n- Email: Brevo (transactional templates)\n- Hosting: Vercel (frontend deployment)\n\n**Design System (from UX Spec):**\n- Component library: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS\n- Typography: Inter\n- Custom components: 7 identified (UploadProgress, RatingScale, MediaViewer, SubmissionCard, ContestCard, RankingDropzone, CodeListTable)\n\n## Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n1. **File Upload Pipeline**\n   - Direct browser → Bunny uploads (bypass server)\n   - Chunked/resumable for large videos\n   - Progress tracking with real-time UI feedback\n   - Timestamp locks on upload start (deadline fairness)\n\n2. **Role-Based Access Control**\n   - Admin: Full access to all data\n   - Judge: Anonymous view only (codes, no PII)\n   - Participant: Own submissions and feedback only\n   - Enforced at database level (RLS policies)\n\n3. **Contest State Machine**\n   - States: Draft → Published → Closed → Reviewed → Finished\n   - Categories have independent status within contests\n   - State transitions trigger notifications\n\n4. **Anonymous Data Isolation**\n   - Judge queries must never join to participant PII\n   - Separate API endpoints or views for judge vs admin\n   - Audit trail for any PII access\n\n5. **Notification System**\n   - Trigger points: Judge assignment, category close, review complete, contest finish\n   - Brevo templates for each notification type\n   - Async processing (don't block user actions)\n\n6. **Bunny Upload Security (CRITICAL)**\n   - **No direct public Bunny endpoints** — All uploads authenticated and authorized\n   - **Signed upload URLs** — Short-lived, single-use URLs generated server-side after validating:\n     - Valid participant code for the contest\n     - Category is still open (not past deadline)\n     - User hasn't exceeded submission limits\n   - **Storage isolation** — Unique paths: `/{contest_id}/{category_id}/{participant_code}/{file}`\n   - **No enumeration** — Participants cannot list or guess other file paths\n   - **Delete protection** — Only submitting participant (pre-deadline) or admin can delete\n   - **Rate limiting** — Per-participant, per-contest limits to prevent abuse\n   - **File validation** — Verify file type and size before accepting\n# Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n## Complete Project Directory Structure\n\n```\nmedia-education-solutions/\n├── PROJECT_INDEX.md                   #

Read `PROJECT_INDEX.md` at project root\n2. Understand all features, contexts, and edge functions that exist\n\n**Before modifying a feature:**\n1. Read `features/{feature}/index.ts` completely\n2. Understand all exports before making changes\n3. Check for related tests (co-located with source)\n\n**After adding new files:**\n1. Add export to the relevant `index.ts` immediately\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding new features, contexts, edge functions, or major components\n\n**After removing files:**\n1. Remove export from the relevant `index.ts`\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if removing features or major components\n\n**NEVER:**\n- Create files without adding to index\n- Delete files without removing from index\n- Import from deep paths (always use index exports)\n- Modify files without first reading the feature's index\n\n## Requirements to Structure Mapping\n\n| Feature Area | Primary Location | Related Files |\n|--------------|------------------|---------------|\n| FR1-FR5: Auth | `features/auth/` | `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` |\n| FR6-FR14: Contests | `features/contests/` | `pages/admin/ContestDetailPage.tsx` |\n| FR15-FR19: Participant Codes | `features/participants/` | `pages/admin/ParticipantCodesPage.tsx` |\n| FR20-FR24: Judge Management | `features/auth/`, `features/categories/` | `supabase/functions/send-notification/` |\n| FR25-FR37: Submissions | `features/submissions/` | `supabase/functions/generate-upload-url/` |\n| FR38-FR48: Judging | `features/reviews/`, `features/rankings/` | `pages/judge/ReviewPage.tsx` |\n| FR49-FR53: Admin Override | `features/reviews/`, `features/rankings/` | `pages/admin/SubmissionsPage.tsx` |\n| FR54-FR60: Winners | `features/rankings/` | `pages/public/WinnersPage.tsx` |\n| FR61-FR64: Notifications | `features/notifications/` | `supabase/functions/send-notification/` |\n\n## Architectural Boundaries\n\n**Import Rules:**\n\n| Layer | Can Import From | Cannot Import From |\n|-------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| `pages/` | `features/` (via index), `components/ui/`, `contexts/`, `lib/` | Other pages directly |\n| `features/*/components/` | `components/ui/`, own feature's hooks/types | Other features (use index) |\n| `features/*/hooks/` | Own feature's api/types, `lib/` | Components |\n| `components/ui/` | `lib/utils.ts` only | Features, pages, contexts |\n\n**Data Flow:**\n\n| Data Type | Managed By | Accessed Via |\n|-----------|------------|--------------|\n| Server data | TanStack Query | Feature hooks |\n| Auth state | AuthContext | `useAuth()` |\n| Participant session | ParticipantSessionContext | `useParticipantSession()` |\n| Form data | React Hook Form | Component-local |\n\n## External Integration Points\n\n| Service | Integration File | Purpose |\n|---------|------------------|---------|\n| Supabase Auth | `lib/supabase.ts`, `features/auth/` | Admin/Judge authentication |\n| Supabase DB | `lib/supabase.ts`, feature API files | All data operations |\n| Bunny Stream | `supabase/functions/generate-upload-url/` | Video upload URLs |\n| Bunny Storage | `supabase/functions/generate-upload-url/` | Photo upload URLs |\n| Brevo | `supabase/functions/send-notification/` | Email notifications |\n| Sentry | `lib/sentry.ts` | Error tracking |\n# Starter Template Evaluation\n\n## Primary Technology Domain\n\nFull-stack web application (React SPA + Supabase BaaS) based on project requirements analysis.\n\n## Selected Approach: Official Manual Setup\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Always up-to-date (Tailwind v4, React 19, Vite 6+)\n- No third-party template dependencies\n- You control exactly what's included\n- Official documentation matches your setup\n\n**Initialization Sequence:**\n\n```bash\n# 1.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

| Button, Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Form (with React Hook Form + Zod) |\n| **Layout** | Card, Dialog, Sheet, Tabs, Separator |\n| **Data Display** | Table, Badge, Progress, Avatar, Skeleton |\n| **Feedback** | Toast, Alert, Tooltip |\n| **Navigation** | Dropdown Menu, Navigation Menu |\n\nAll components used as-is with Untitled UI color tokens applied via Tailwind config.\n\n## Custom Components\n\n### `<UploadProgress>`\n**Purpose:** The defining upload experience for participants\n**Content:** File name, progress bar, percentage, upload speed, processing state\n**States:** Idle, Uploading, Processing, Complete, Error\n**Key Feature:** Smooth progress animation, clear error recovery\n\n### `<RatingScale>`\n**Purpose:** 5-tier judge rating selection\n**Content:** Five labeled tiers (Developing Skills → Master Creator) with numeric ranges\n**States:** Unselected, Hovered, Selected\n**Key Feature:** Visual feedback on selection, keyboard accessible\n\n### `<SubmissionCard>`\n**Purpose:** Anonymous submission display for judges\n**Content:** Participant code, media thumbnail, rating status, feedback preview\n**States:** Unreviewed, In Progress, Reviewed\n**Key Feature:** No PII visible — code only\n\n### `<MediaViewer>`\n**Purpose:** Full-screen photo/video display\n**Content:** Photo or video with playback controls\n**States:** Loading, Playing, Paused, Fullscreen, Error\n**Key Feature:** Esc to exit, Spacebar play/pause, arrow keys for next/prev\n\n### `<CodeListTable>`\n**Purpose:** Participant code management for admin\n**Content:** Code, status (Used/Unused), participant name if used\n**States:** Default, Filtered, Exporting\n**Key Feature:** Bulk export, status filtering\n\n### `<ContestCard>`\n**Purpose:** Dashboard overview card for each contest\n**Content:** Contest name, status badge, submission count, judge progress\n**States:** Draft, Published, Closed, Reviewed, Finished\n**Key Feature:** Answers \"how is this contest doing?\" at a glance\n\n### `<RankingDropzone>`\n**Purpose:** Drag-and-drop top 3 ranking for judges\n**Content:** Three numbered positions with submission cards\n**States:** Empty, Partially filled, Complete\n**Key Feature:** Drag to reorder, visual feedback on drop\n\n## Component Implementation Strategy\n\n**Build Order (by user journey criticality):**\n\n| Priority | Component | Needed For |\n|----------|-----------|------------|\n| P0 | `<UploadProgress>` | Participant upload (defining experience) |\n| P0 | `<RatingScale>` | Judge review flow |\n| P0 | `<MediaViewer>` | Judge review flow |\n| P1 | `<SubmissionCard>` | Judge review flow |\n| P1 | `<ContestCard>` | Admin dashboard |\n| P1 | `<RankingDropzone>` | Judge ranking |\n| P2 | `<CodeListTable>` | Admin code management |\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\n- Build on top of shadcn/ui primitives where possible\n- Use Tailwind for styling consistency\n- Follow component library discipline (all variants in one file)\n# Core User Experience\n\n## Defining Experience\n\nThe platform serves three distinct user types with fundamentally different core actions:\n\n| Role | Primary Action | Frequency |\n|------|---------------|-----------|\n| **Super Admin (Jeb)** | Creating/editing contests + monitoring progress + overriding judges | Daily during active contests |\n| **Judges** | Rating submissions + writing feedback + ranking top 3 | Session-based (45-min blocks) |\n| **Participants** | Uploading creative work + confirming submission | One-time per category (with possible edits) |\n\nThe platform must excel at all three, but **Judge review flow** is the make-or-break interaction — frustrated judges create support burden for Jeb, undermining the platform's core value proposition.\n\n## Platform Strategy\n\n**Primary:** Desktop/laptop (all user types)\n**Secondary:** Mobile responsive (same interface, fluid adaptation)\n\n- No separate mobile-specific interfaces or touch-optimized variants\n- Responsive design ensures usability across screen sizes\n- Participants may occasionally submit from mobile (CapCut editors, etc.)\n- Judges may review on-the-go in limited scenarios\n- Admin workflows assume full keyboard/mouse environment\n\n## Effortless Interactions\n\n| Role | Effortless Moment | Design Implication |\n|------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **Jeb** | \"How is this contest doing?\" | Dashboard answers in one glance — no clicks required |\n| **Judges** | \"What do I review next?\" | Obvious next action, never ambiguous |\n| **Participants** | \"Did my upload work?\" | Unmistakable confirmation, no uncertainty |\n\n## Critical Success Moments\n\n1. **Upload Completion** — Sofia at 11:51 PM must feel absolute certainty her submission succeeded\n2. **Judge First Session** — Marcus's first 10 minutes determine if he'll finish or abandon\n3. **Contest Launch** — Jeb publishing a contest and seeing codes generate instantly\n4. **Deadline Crunch** — 100+ simultaneous uploads completing without failure\n\n## Experience Principles\n\n1. **Clarity Over Cleverness** — Every screen answers \"what do I do here?\" in under 3 seconds\n2. **Confidence at Every Step** — Users always know: Did it work? What's next? Am I done?\n3. **Desktop-First, Responsive Always** — Optimize for laptop workflows, never break on mobile\n4. **Reliability is UX** — Technical performance IS the user experience\n5. **Role-Appropriate Density** — Same design system, right information density per context\n# Defining Experience\n\n## The Core Moment\n\n**\"Upload and be certain\"**\n\nThe participant upload experience is the defining interaction for Media Education Solutions. This is the highest-stakes moment — Sofia at 11:59 PM, racing the deadline, needing absolute confidence that her work is safe.\n\nIf we nail this moment, everything else follows:\n- Participants trust the platform\n- Jeb doesn't get \"did my upload work?\" emails\n- The product earns word-of-mouth recommendations\n\n## User Mental Model\n\n**What participants expect:**\n- Progress that feels real (not fake progress bars)\n- Clear feedback at every stage\n- Ability to preview before final submit\n- Unmistakable confirmation when done\n- Graceful handling if something goes wrong\n\n**Current frustrations with uploads:**\n- Vague progress indicators\n- No idea if it's working or frozen\n- Unclear error messages when something fails\n- Anxiety about whether it actually went through\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n| Criteria | Target |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Confidence** | User never wonders \"is it working?\" |\n| **Progress clarity** | Percentage + speed + time remaining visible |\n| **Deadline fairness** | Timestamp captured at upload START, not completion |\n| **Completion certainty** | Unmistakable confirmation with timestamp |\n| **Verification** | Preview before final submit |\n\n## Submission Timestamp Logic (CRITICAL)\n\nTo protect participants with slow connections during deadline crunch:\n\n| Event | Timestamp Behavior |\n|-------|-------------------|\n| Upload starts at 11:59 PM | Timestamp **locks** at 11:59 PM |\n| Upload completes at 12:03 AM | Grace period begins (10-15 minutes) |\n| Submit clicked within grace period | Submission time = **11:59 PM** (protected) |\n| Submit clicked after grace period expires | Submission time = **actual click time** (late) |\n\n**UX Implications:**\n- Show locked timestamp prominently during upload: \"Your submission time: 11:59 PM\"\n- After upload completes, show countdown: \"Submit within 14:32 to keep your 11:59 PM timestamp\"\n- If grace period expires, update messaging: \"Your submission time will be when you click Submit\"\n\n## Experience Mechanics\n\n**Stage 1: Initiation**\n- Generous drag-and-drop zone (not a tiny button)\n- File specs visible: \"Up to 500MB • MP4, MOV, WebM\"\n- Instant validation before upload begins (format, size)\n- Click-to-browse as fallback\n\n**Stage 2: Upload Progress**\n- **Timestamp locks when upload starts** — display prominently\n- Smooth progress bar (no jumps or freezes)\n- Real metrics: \"67% • 2.3 MB/s • ~45 seconds remaining\"\n- Connection quality indicator\n- Cancel option always visible\n\n**Stage 3: Processing**\n- \"Processing video...\" state after upload completes\n- Explain what's happening: \"Preparing your video for playback...\"\n- Show processing progress if available from Bunny\n- Grace period countdown begins\n\n**Stage 4: Preview**\n- Thumbnail generated and displayed\n- Play button to verify correct file\n- File details visible (duration, size)\n- Grace period countdown visible: \"Submit within 12:45 to lock your 11:59 PM time\"\n\n**Stage 5: Confirmation**\n- Big submit button: \"Submit to [Category Name]\"\n- Post-submit confirmation screen:\n  - Green checkmark, unmistakable success\n  - \"Submitted at 11:59 PM — before the 12:00 AM deadline\"\n  - Submission reference code\n  - \"You can edit until [deadline]\" if applicable\n  - Screenshot-worthy for Sofia to send to her coach\n\n**Error Handling**\n- Connection slow: \"Upload continuing... connection is slow but stable\"\n- Connection lost: \"Connection interrupted. [Try again]\" (resumable upload if Bunny supports it — verify during implementation)\n- File rejected: Specific reason + what to do (\"File is 520MB. Maximum is 500MB. [Choose different file]\")\n- Server error: \"Something went wrong on our end. [Try again] — your file is safe locally\"\n\n## Pattern Classification\n\n**Established patterns we're using:**\n- Drag-and-drop upload (Dropbox, Google Drive)\n- Progress bar with real metrics (WeTransfer)\n- Preview before submit (YouTube)\n- Confirmation with timestamp (form submissions)\n\n**Our refinements:**\n- Timestamp locks at upload START (deadline fairness)\n- Grace period with visible countdown\n- \"Deadline-aware\" messaging throughout\n- Screenshot-worthy confirmation (Sofia texts her coach)\n\n**Implementation Notes:**\n- Resumable uploads: Verify if Bunny supports this; if not, design graceful retry\n- Grace period duration: Recommend 10-15 minutes, confirm with Jeb\n# Design Direction Decision\n\n## Chosen Direction\n\n**Premium European Design** — A singular, cohesive direction established through collaborative discovery.\n\n| Element | Decision |\n|---------|----------|\n| **Aesthetic** | Scandinavian/Swiss restraint — every element earns its place |\n| **Color System** | Untitled UI palette |\n| **Typography** | Inter |\n| **Components** | shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS |\n| **Inspiration** | Linear, Untitled UI, Stripe |\n| **Mode** | Light only |\n| **Density** | Role-based (dense for Admin, spacious for Judges/Participants) |\n\n## Design Rationale\n\nNo exploratory mockups were needed — the design direction emerged clearly through our conversation:\n\n1. **Inspiration alignment** — Linear, Untitled UI, and Stripe share a common visual language that maps directly to implementation via shadcn/ui\n2. **Technical consistency** — shadcn/ui + Tailwind provides the exact aesthetic without custom design work\n3. **User-appropriate density** — Role-based spacing addresses the distinct needs of power users (Jeb) vs. occasional users (Judges, Participants)\n4. **Simplicity** — Light mode only reduces complexity and maintenance burden\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nThe design direction is immediately implementable:\n- Install shadcn/ui components into the React + Vite project\n- Configure Tailwind with Untitled UI color tokens\n- Apply Inter typeface via Google Fonts or local hosting\n- Follow component library discipline (all UI from shared components)\n\nNo custom design tokens or component variants needed beyond what shadcn/ui provides.\n# Design Direction\n\n**Inspiration:** Linear, shadcn/ui, Untitled UI, Stripe\n\n**Aesthetic:** Modern, sleek, minimal. Clean typography, generous whitespace, subtle animations that feel purposeful rather than decorative. Dark mode consideration. Professional polish that builds trust.\n\n---\n# Design System Foundation\n\n## Design System Choice\n\n**Primary:** shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS\n**Typography:** Inter\n**Mode:** Light only\n\nThis combination provides:\n- Linear/Untitled UI/Stripe-level polish out of the box\n- Full ownership of component code (copy into project, not npm dependency)\n- Tailwind's utility-first approach for consistent spacing and styling\n- Accessible, keyboard-navigable components by default\n\n## Rationale for Selection\n\n| Requirement | How shadcn/ui + Tailwind Delivers |\n|-------------|----------------------------------|\n| Modern, sleek aesthetic | Matches Linear/Untitled UI visual language exactly |\n| Inter typeface | Default font, no configuration needed |\n| Component consistency | Pre-built, tested components with unified API |\n| React + Vite stack | Native integration, no adapters needed |\n| Customization control | Own the code, modify freely, no vendor lock-in |\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n**Component Library Discipline (CRITICAL)**\n\nEvery UI element MUST use shared components from the design system. No exceptions.\n\n| Rule | Rationale |\n|------|-----------|\n| All buttons use `<Button>` component | Update once, propagate everywhere |\n| All inputs use `<Input>` component | Consistent validation, focus states, sizing |\n| All cards use `<Card>` component | Unified shadows, borders, padding |\n| No inline Tailwind for component-level styling | Prevents visual drift and inconsistency |\n| New patterns go into component library first | Then used across the app |\n\n**Folder Structure:**\n```\nsrc/\n  components/\n    ui/           # shadcn/ui base components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)\n    composed/     # App-specific composed components (SubmissionCard, RatingScale, etc.)\n```\n\n**Enforcement:**\n- Code reviews must verify component library usage\n- No raw `<button>` or `<input>` elements in feature code\n- Tailwind utilities allowed for layout (flex, grid, spacing) but not for component styling\n\n## Customization Strategy\n\n**Design Tokens (via Tailwind config):**\n- Colors: Primary, secondary, success, warning, error, neutral scale\n- Spacing: Consistent 4px base unit\n- Border radius: Subtle, consistent across components\n- Shadows: Minimal, purposeful (not decorative)\n\n**Component Variants:**\n- Button: primary, secondary, ghost, destructive\n- Badge: status colors mapped to contest/submission states\n- Progress: Linear style for judge review progress\n\n**Custom Components (to build):**\n- `<UploadProgress>` — Stripe-quality upload experience\n- `<RatingScale>` — 5-tier judge rating with visual feedback\n- `<SubmissionCard>` — Anonymous submission display for judges\n- `<ContestStatusBadge>` — Draft/Published/Closed/Reviewed/Finished states\n# Desired Emotional Response\n\n## Primary Emotional Goals\n\n| User | Emotional Arc | Design Goal |\n|------|---------------|-------------|\n| **Jeb (Super Admin)** | Overwhelmed → In Control | \"I've got this\" — platform reduces cognitive load, not adds to it |\n| **Judges** | Skeptical → Surprised Relief | \"That was actually fine\" — zero learning curve, obvious next steps |\n| **Participants** | Deadline Anxiety → Confident Relief | \"It worked!\" — unmistakable confirmation, pride in submission |\n\n## Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n**First Discovery:**\n- Jeb: \"This looks like it'll actually solve my problem\"\n- Judges: \"Okay, this doesn't look complicated\"\n- Participants: \"I know exactly what to do\"\n\n**Core Experience:**\n- Jeb: Calm confidence while monitoring multiple contests\n- Judges: Focused flow state, one submission at a time\n- Participants: Trust during upload, anticipation while processing\n\n**Task Completion:**\n- Jeb: Satisfaction seeing contests progress without intervention\n- Judges: Accomplishment at \"18 of 18 reviewed\" — a job well done\n- Participants: Relief and pride at confirmed submission\n\n**Error States:**\n- All users: Calm, clear, honest — never panicky or vague\n- Actionable recovery: \"Your upload was interrupted at 67%. Resume?\"\n- Reassurance: Progress is saved, nothing is lost\n\n## Micro-Emotions\n\n| Emotion Pair | Priority | Design Implication |\n|--------------|----------|-------------------|\n| **Confidence vs. Confusion** | Critical | Every action has clear feedback, every screen has obvious next step |\n| **Trust vs. Skepticism** | Critical | Explicit confirmations, visible saves, reliable infrastructure |\n| **Accomplishment vs. Frustration** | High | Progress indicators, completion celebrations, batch operations |\n| **Calm vs. Anxiety** | High | Generous timeouts, graceful error handling, reassuring copy |\n\n## Design Implications\n\n| Emotional Goal | UX Design Approach |\n|----------------|-------------------|\n| \"I've got this\" (Jeb) | Dashboard that answers questions at a glance, no hunting for information |\n| \"That was fine\" (Judges) | One-thing-at-a-time interface, obvious progress, clear completion |\n| \"It worked!\" (Participants) | Upload progress theater, unmistakable confirmation, preview before submit |\n| Calm error states | Specific error messages, clear recovery paths, saved progress indicators |\n\n## Emotional Design Principles\n\n1. **Confidence Through Clarity** — Every interaction confirms what happened and what's next\n2. **Trust Through Reliability** — The platform does what it says, saves what it should, never loses work\n3. **Accomplishment Through Progress** — Visible progress creates momentum and satisfaction\n4. **Calm Through Honesty** — When things go wrong, be specific, actionable, and reassuring\n5. **Relief Through Simplicity** — Reduce cognitive load; the platform thinks so users don't have to\n# Executive Summary\n\n## Project Vision\n\nMedia Education Solutions is a contest management platform that transforms manual coordination chaos into orchestrated simplicity. The platform serves three distinct user types — each should feel like it was purpose-built for them. Built with a modern, sleek aesthetic inspired by Linear, shadcn/ui, Untitled UI, and Stripe.\n\n## Target Users\n\n| User | Tech Comfort | Primary Emotion | UX Priority |\n|------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| **Jeb (Super Admin)** | High | \"I need control without overwhelm\" | Dashboard clarity, batch operations, zero guesswork |\n| **Judges** | Low | \"Just tell me what to do\" | Pristine simplicity, obvious progress, one-thing-at-a-time |\n| **Participants** | High | \"Will this work? Please work.\" | Upload confidence, deadline assurance, clear confirmation |\n| **T/L/C** | Irrelevant | \"Don't make me log in\" | Email-only interaction |\n\n## Key Design Challenges\n\n1. **The Judge Paradox** — Domain experts who are NOT tech-savvy. Interface must feel so obvious that reluctant judges think \"that was... actually fine\" after their first session. Zero learning curve.\n\n2. **Deadline Crunch Anxiety** — Participants uploading large videos minutes before deadline need absolute confidence. Progress indicators must be butter-smooth, confirmation unmistakable.\n\n3. **Anonymous-to-Revealed Transition** — Judges see only codes during review, but Admin sees everything. Admin view must surface participant data without breaking the mental model of anonymous judging.\n\n4. **Multi-Role, Single Platform** — Three distinct experiences sharing one codebase. Each role should feel purpose-built, not compromised.\n\n## Design Opportunities\n\n1. **Visual Sophistication** — Linear-inspired visual language: subtle gradients, refined typography, generous whitespace, premium \"this feels expensive\" quality across all screens.\n\n2. **Progress-as-Delight** — Judge progress bars that feel satisfying to fill. Subtle dopamine hit at completion with clean completion states.\n\n3. **Upload Confidence Theater** — Make upload experience feel expensive. Smooth progress, processing states, preview before submit, unmistakable confirmation.\n\n4. **Contextual Density** — Admin dashboard can be data-rich; Judge view should be zen-minimal. Same design system, different information density per role.\n# UX Design Specification: Media Education Solutions\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [UX Design Specification: Media Education

status at a glance\n- Drill-down for actions, not just viewing\n\n---\n\n## Journey Patterns\n\n**Common patterns across all flows:**\n\n| Pattern | Implementation |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Entry clarity** | Every flow starts with obvious entry point and clear first action |\n| **Progress visibility** | Users always know where they are and what's left |\n| **Confirmation explicitness** | Actions that matter get explicit confirmation (\"Submitted at 11:51 PM\") |\n| **Error recovery** | Every failure state has a clear recovery path |\n| **Exit clarity** | Users know when they're done and what happens next |\n\n## Flow Optimization Principles\n\n1. **Minimize clicks to value** — Sofia uploads in 4 steps, not 10\n2. **Show don't tell** — Progress bars over text descriptions\n3. **Smart defaults** — Auto-fill participant info, auto-generate codes\n4. **Contextual actions** — Show only relevant actions for current state\n5. **Batch operations** — Jeb generates 50 codes at once, not one by one\n# UX Consistency Patterns\n\n## Button Hierarchy\n\n| Level | Style | Usage |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| **Primary** | Solid, brand color | One per screen — the main action (Submit, Publish, Save) |\n| **Secondary** | Outlined | Alternative actions (Cancel, Back, Save Draft) |\n| **Ghost** | Text only | Tertiary actions (Learn more, View details) |\n| **Destructive** | Red solid | Dangerous actions (Delete, Remove) — always with confirmation |\n\n**Rules:**\n- Never more than one Primary button visible at a time\n- Destructive actions require confirmation dialog\n- Button text uses verbs: \"Submit Entry\" not \"Submission\"\n\n## Feedback Patterns\n\n| Type | Style | Duration | Usage |\n|------|-------|----------|-------|\n| **Success** | Green toast, top-right | 4 seconds | Confirmations: \"Contest published\", \"Rating saved\" |\n| **Error** | Red toast, top-right | Until dismissed | Failures: \"Upload failed\", \"Connection lost\" |\n| **Warning** | Amber inline | Persistent | Deadlines: \"Deadline in 2 hours\" |\n| **Info** | Blue inline | Persistent | Guidance: \"Judges will see anonymous codes only\" |\n\n**Rules:**\n- Success toasts auto-dismiss\n- Error toasts require user dismissal (with clear action)\n- Never stack more than 2 toasts\n- Inline messages for contextual warnings (near the relevant element)\n\n## Form Patterns\n\n**Validation:**\n- Validate on blur (not on every keystroke)\n- Show errors inline below the field\n- Green checkmark for valid fields (optional, not required)\n- Error messages are specific: \"File must be under 500MB\" not \"Invalid file\"\n\n**Layout:**\n- Single column forms (no side-by-side fields except related pairs like city/state)\n- Labels above inputs (not inline)\n- Required fields marked with subtle asterisk\n- Submit button at bottom, full width on mobile\n\n**Auto-save:**\n- Admin forms auto-save drafts\n- Participant uploads do NOT auto-submit (explicit action required)\n\n## Navigation Patterns\n\n**Admin (Jeb):**\n- Sidebar navigation (256px, collapsible on mobile)\n- Breadcrumbs for deep navigation (Contest > Category > Submission)\n- Tabs for related views (Contest Details, Codes, Judges, Submissions)\n\n**Judge (Marcus):**\n- Minimal navigation — focus on the task\n- Progress indicator always visible\n- Back/Next for sequential review\n- No sidebar (distraction-free)\n\n**Participant (Sofia):**\n- Step indicator for multi-step flow\n- Clear \"back\" option without losing progress\n- No navigation menu (single-purpose flow)\n\n## Empty States\n\n| Context | Message | Action |\n|---------|---------|--------|\n| No contests | \"No contests yet\" | \"Create your first contest\" button |\n| No submissions | \"No submissions in this category\" | Show deadline reminder |\n| No assigned reviews | \"All caught up!\" | Celebrate completion |\n| No codes generated | \"Codes generate when you publish\" | Explain next step |\n\n**Rules:**\n- Empty states always explain why it's empty\n- Include a primary action when applicable\n- Use illustrations sparingly (only if brand includes them)\n\n## Loading States\n\n| Context | Pattern |\n|---------|---------|\n| Page load | Skeleton (content shapes) |\n| Button action | Spinner inside button, button disabled |\n| Upload | Progress bar with percentage |\n| Data fetch | Skeleton for content area only |\n\n**Rules:**\n- Skeletons for content (tables, cards, text)\n- Spinners for actions (buttons, submissions)\n- Never block the entire screen unless absolutely necessary\n- Show progress for anything > 2 seconds\n\n## Status Badge Patterns\n\n| Status | Color | Context |\n|--------|-------|---------|\n| Draft | Gray | Contest not yet published |\n| Published | Blue | Contest accepting submissions |\n| Closed | Amber | Submissions closed, judging active |\n| Reviewed | Purple | Judging complete, pending finalization |\n| Finished | Green | Results published |\n| Used | Gray | Participant code has been used |\n| Unused | Subtle border only | Participant code available |\n\n**Rules:**\n- Badges include text label (not color alone)\n- Consistent across all contexts (cards, tables, details)\n# UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n## Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n| Product | Core Strength | Key Lesson for Media Education Solutions |\n|---------|---------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Linear** | Minimal chrome, subtle gradients, typography that breathes | Information density without clutter — Jeb's dashboard can be data-rich without feeling overwhelming |\n| **shadcn/ui** | Component consistency, accessible defaults, \"copy and own\" philosophy | Sensible defaults — every button, input, card works beautifully without heavy customization |\n| **Untitled UI** | Enterprise polish with startup aesthetics, clean data tables, scalable tokens | Dashboard patterns — lots of information, zero confusion; perfect for contest monitoring |\n| **Stripe** | \"Feels expensive\" quality, intentional micro-interactions, helpful error states | Trust through polish — every detail signals competence; critical for upload confidence |\n\n## Transferable UX Patterns\n\n**Navigation & Layout (from Linear + Untitled UI)**\n- Sidebar navigation with clear hierarchy\n- Contextual headers that tell you where you are\n- Generous whitespace that lets content breathe\n- Subtle borders and shadows, never heavy dividers\n\n**Components & Interactions (from shadcn/ui + Stripe)**\n- Consistent button hierarchy (primary/secondary/ghost)\n- Form inputs with clear focus states and inline validation\n- Cards with subtle hover states\n- Toast notifications for confirmations and errors\n\n**Data Display (from Linear + Untitled UI)**\n- Tables that scale gracefully with data volume\n- Progress indicators that feel satisfying to watch\n- Status badges with semantic colors (not just red/green)\n- Metric cards that answer questions at a glance\n\n**Feedback & Confirmation (from Stripe)**\n- Micro-animations on state changes (not decorative, functional)\n- Explicit success states (\"Saved\" not just removing a spinner)\n- Error messages with context and recovery actions\n- Loading states that indicate progress, not just \"working...\"\n\n## Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Our Alternative |\n|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| **Modal overload** | Interrupts flow, feels like being trapped | Inline editing, slide-overs for complex forms |\n| **Vague confirmations** | \"Success!\" means nothing | Specific: \"Contest published. 50 codes generated.\" |\n| **Hidden actions** | Three-dot menus for primary actions | Primary actions visible, secondary in menus |\n| **Skeleton overuse** | Can feel slower than spinners for quick loads | Skeletons for content, spinners for actions |\n| **Aggressive validation** | Yelling at users before they finish typing | Validate on blur, show errors gently |\n| **Dark mode complexity** | Toggle adds maintenance burden, edge cases | Light mode only — clean, consistent, maintainable |\n| **Keyboard shortcut overload** | Power-user features that most users ignore | Minimal shortcuts for genuinely useful actions only |\n\n## Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**Adopt Directly:**\n- Untitled UI's Inter typeface and typography scale\n- shadcn/ui component patterns (buttons, inputs, cards, tables)\n- Stripe's error state copywriting approach\n- Untitled UI's dashboard card patterns\n- Linear's whitespace philosophy\n\n**Adapt for Our Context:**\n- Linear's information density — simplify for Judge's \"one thing at a time\" need\n- Stripe's polish level — maintain for critical paths (upload, submission), lighter touch elsewhere\n- Untitled UI's data tables — streamline for our specific contest/category/submission hierarchy\n\n**Explicit Constraints:**\n- Light mode only (no dark mode, no toggle)\n- Inter typeface throughout\n- Minimal keyboard shortcuts:\n  - **Esc** — exit fullscreen view\n  - **Spacebar** — play/pause video\n  - **← →** — previous/next submission (Judge review only)\n# Visual Design Foundation\n\n## Design Aesthetic\n\n**Premium European Design Language**\n\nThe visual identity draws from Scandinavian/Swiss design principles:\n- Restraint as luxury — every element earns its place\n- Whitespace as a design element, not empty space\n- Typography-forward hierarchy\n- Color used sparingly and purposefully\n- Quiet confidence over flashy decoration\n\n## Color System\n\n**Foundation:** Untitled UI color palette\n\n**Neutral Scale (Primary UI Colors):**\n| Token | Usage |\n|-------|-------|\n| Gray-50 | Page backgrounds |\n| Gray-100 | Card

Headings |\n| Gray-900 | Primary text, high contrast |\n\n**Brand/Primary Color:**\n- Untitled UI primary (clean blue or neutral accent)\n- Used sparingly: primary buttons, active states, key actions\n- Not splashed everywhere — reserved for what matters\n\n**Semantic Colors:**\n| Token | Color | Usage |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| Success | Green | Confirmations, completed states, \"Submitted successfully\" |\n| Warning | Amber | Deadlines approaching, grace period countdown |\n| Error | Red | Failed uploads, validation errors |\n| Info | Blue | Informational messages, tips |\n\n**Status Badge Colors (Contest/Submission States):**\n| Status | Color Treatment |\n|--------|----------------|\n| Draft | Gray, muted |\n| Published | Blue, active |\n| Closed | Amber, attention

section separation |\n\n**Role-Based Density:**\n\n| Role | Density | Rationale |\n|------|---------|-----------|\n| **Admin (Jeb)** | Higher density | Needs to scan lots of data quickly; comfortable with information-rich views |\n| **Judges** | Medium-low density | Focus on one submission at a time; reduce cognitive load |\n| **Participants** | Low density | Generous spacing builds confidence; reduces anxiety during upload |\n\n**Layout Principles:**\n- Max content width: 1280px (centered on large screens)\n- Sidebar navigation: 256px fixed width\n- Card padding: 24px standard\n- Form field spacing: 16px between fields\n- Button spacing: 12px between grouped buttons\n\n## Accessibility Considerations\n\n**Contrast Ratios:**\n- Body text on backgrounds: Minimum 4.5:1 (WCAG AA)\n- Large text (18px+): Minimum 3:1\n- Interactive elements: Clear focus states with visible outlines\n\n**Touch Targets:**\n- Minimum 44x44px for interactive elements\n- Generous click/tap areas on mobile\n\n**Color Independence:**\n- Never rely on color alone to convey meaning\n- Status badges include text labels, not just color\n- Error states include icons + text, not just red color\n\n**Reduced Motion:**\n- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` system setting\n- Animations are subtle and purposeful, not decorative\n- No auto-playing animations or videos\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(`src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx`#L4, `src/pages/auth/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx`#L2, `src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`#L3, `src/router/index.tsx`#L11) - FIXED: All imports now use feature index exports\n   119\t- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] AC6 says redirect to `/judge`, but code redirects to `/judge/dashboard`. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`#L42, `src/router/AdminRoute.tsx`#L48) - FIXED: AdminRoute now redirects to /judge\n   120\t- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Uncommitted `.codex` changes not documented in File List. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`#L432) - RESOLVED: .codex files are not part of implementation artifacts\n   121\t- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] React namespace usage violates project rules in tests. (`src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.test.tsx`#L12) - FIXED: Changed React.ReactNode to import type { ReactNode }\n   122\t- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] AC2 requires exact error text; error message includes a trailing period. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`#L20, `src/lib/errorCodes.ts`#L35) - FIXED: Removed trailing period from error message\n   123\t- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Process Failure: Work Not Staged or Committed. Files created/modified but not `git add`ed. (All 24 files listed in \"File List\")\n   124\t- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] AC6: Judge Role Redirect (AC6) points to `/judge` instead of `/judge/dashboard`. (`src/router/AdminRoute.tsx`, Line 48)\n   125\t- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Architectural Flaw: Redundant `isLoading` State. `LoginForm.tsx` has local `isLoading` instead of using `useAuth`'s. (`src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.tsx`, Line 28)\n   126\t- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Architectural Flaw: Inconsistent API Exports in `authApi.ts`. Exports individual functions AND a bundled object. (`src/features/auth/api/authApi.ts`, Lines 28-135)\n   127\t- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Missing Requirement: Manual Tests Not Performed. Task 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 are unchecked. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`) - COMPLETED: All manual tests pass (2026-01-12)\n   128\t- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Missing Requirement: Error Codes Not Used. `authApi.ts` throws generic strings instead of `ERROR_CODES`. (`src/features/auth/api/authApi.ts`, Lines 40, 44, 57, 69, 83, 97)\n   129\t- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Missing File: `src/pages/judge/DashboardPage.tsx` Placeholder. File exists at `src/pages/judge/DashboardPage.tsx`.\n   130\t- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Inefficient Data Fetching. `AuthProvider.tsx` calls `fetchUserProfile` on `TOKEN_REFRESHED`. (`src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`, Line 61 - removed)\n   131\t- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Missing Exports in `index.ts` files. All exports verified complete in `src/features/auth/index.ts`, `src/pages/index.ts`, `src/contexts/index.ts`.\n   132\t- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Redundant `isAuthenticated` Memoization in `AuthProvider.tsx`. (`src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`, Line 102 - now computed inline)\n   133\t- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Story 2.1 scope includes admin layout, contests placeholder, and RLS migration not in Tasks/ACs. (`src/features/admin/components/AdminLayout.tsx`#L1) - RESOLVED: Story 2.2 (Admin Layout) was implemented during Story 2.1 code review iterations. All Story 2.2 work is completed, tested (9 tests pass), committed in this branch, and documented in 2-2-admin-layout-dashboard-shell.md. RLS migration (is_admin function) was necessary fix for AC5-AC7 to work correctly. \n   134\t- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] React namespace usage in UI primitives violates project rules. (`src/components/ui/avatar.tsx`#L1) - RESOLVED: Added exception to project-context.md for shadcn/ui components. These are auto-generated by shadcn CLI and use their canonical React namespace style (9 files). Project rule applies to features/, pages/, contexts/, router/, lib/ only.\n   135\t- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Missing tests for auth state and route protection (AC5–AC7). (`src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`#L1) - RESOLVED: Created comprehensive test files (AuthProvider.test.tsx - 10 tests, AdminRoute.test.tsx - 5 tests, ProtectedRoute.test.tsx - 5 tests). All 56 project tests pass. Tests cover: initial state, signIn/signOut, session subscription, loading states, unauthenticated redirects (AC5), judge role redirects (AC6), admin access.\n   136\t- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] `ForgotPasswordPage` rethrows errors; no catch in form leads to unhandled rejection noise. (`src/pages/auth/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx`#L11) - RESOLVED: Added catch block in ForgotPasswordForm.tsx to handle rethrown errors gracefully. Form now properly prevents success state on error without unhandled rejection noise.\n   137\t- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] React namespace type usage remains in router tests (violates project rule). Possible fix: replace `React.ReactNode` with `type ReactNode` import from `react` and use `children: ReactNode` in both files. (`src/router/AdminRoute.test.tsx`#L33, `src/router/ProtectedRoute.test.tsx`#L33) - FIXED: Added `import { type ReactNode } from 'react'` and changed `children: React.ReactNode` to `children: ReactNode` in both test files\n   138\t- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] AC6 says redirect to `/judge`, but `/judge` immediately redirects to `/judge/dashboard`, so effective destination does not match AC text. Decide desired target and align AC or routing. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`#L45, `src/router/index.tsx`#L46) - RESOLVED: Updated AC6 text to say \"(/judge/dashboard)\" to accurately reflect the effective destination after routing\n   139\t- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] AC6 redirect mismatch between epic vs story vs router. Choose canonical target and align Epic 2 Story 2.1 text + router accordingly. (`_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics/epic-2-super-admin-authentication-contest-management.md`, `src/router/index.tsx`) - RESOLVED: Aligned to /judge/dashboard everywhere. Updated epic AC6, LoginPage.tsx redirects directly to /judge/dashboard, AdminRoute.tsx redirects to /judge/dashboard. Eliminates intermediate redirect for consistency with admin pattern.\n   140\t- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] AC7 (participant session redirect) not implemented; no participant session detection/guard in admin routes. Decide to implement in Story 2.1 or move AC7 to Epic 4 (participant session). (`src/router/AdminRoute.tsx`, `src/router/ProtectedRoute.tsx`) - RESOLVED: AC7 deferred to Epic 4. Participant sessions require ParticipantSessionContext (Epic 4). Cannot implement or test without contest/participant data. Current implementation already blocks unauthenticated users (AC5). AC7 marked as deferred in both story and epic.\n   141\t\n   142\t## Dev Notes\n   143\t\n   144\t\n   145\t### Database Already Set Up\n   146\t\n   147\tThe profiles table and auth trigger already exist from Epic 1 (Story 1-2):\n   148\t- `profiles` table with id, email, role ('admin' | 'judge'), first_name, last_name\n   149\t- Role protection trigger prevents users from changing their own role\n   150\t- New users default to 'judge' role (admin must be set manually in DB)\n   151\t\n   152\t**To create a Super Admin for testing:**\n   153\t```sql\n   154\t-- After signing up via Supabase Auth, update role to admin\n   155\tUPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';\n   156\t```\n   157\t\n   158\t### Auth Flow Architecture\n   159\t\n   160\t```\n   161\t┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n   162\t│                        Auth Flow                                 │\n   163\t├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n   164\t│  1.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
