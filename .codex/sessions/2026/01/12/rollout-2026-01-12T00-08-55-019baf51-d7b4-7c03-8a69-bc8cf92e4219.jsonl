Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Connect GitHub repository to Vercel\n2. Import project with auto-detected Vite settings\n3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard:\n   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL\n   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anon/public key\n   - `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` - Sentry project DSN\n4. Enable automatic deployments:\n   - Production: Push to `main` branch\n   - Preview: Any PR opened\n\n**Deployment Behavior:**\n- `main` push → Production deployment\n- PR opened → Preview deployment with unique URL (e.g., `project-abc123.vercel.app`)\n\n### Sentry Configuration\n\n**Install Sentry:**\n```bash\nnpm install @sentry/react\n```\n\n**Create `src/lib/sentry.ts`:**\n```typescript\nimport * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';\n\nexport function initSentry(): void {\n  // Only initialize in production\n  if (import.meta.env.PROD && import.meta.env.VITE_SENTRY_DSN) {\n    Sentry.init({\n      dsn: import.meta.env.VITE_SENTRY_DSN,\n      environment: import.meta.env.MODE,\n      // Performance monitoring (optional, can be enabled later)\n      // tracesSampleRate: 0.1,\n      // Session replay (optional, can be enabled later)\n      // replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,\n      // replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nexport { Sentry };\n```\n\n**Update `src/main.tsx`:**\n```typescript\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react';\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport { QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { queryClient, initSentry } from '@/lib';\nimport App from './App';\nimport './index.css';\n\n// Initialize Sentry before React renders\ninitSentry();\n\ncreateRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(\n  <StrictMode>\n    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>\n      <App />\n    </QueryClientProvider>\n  </StrictMode>\n);\n```\n\n### Error Boundary\n\n**Create `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`:**\n```typescript\nimport * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui';\n\nfunction FallbackComponent({\n  error,\n  resetErrorBoundary\n}: {\n  error: Error;\n  resetErrorBoundary: () => void\n}) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center p-4\">\n      <div className=\"text-center max-w-md\">\n        <h1 className=\"text-2xl font-bold text-destructive mb-4\">\n          Something went wrong\n        </h1>\n        <p className=\"text-muted-foreground mb-6\">\n          We've been notified and are working on a fix. Please try again.\n        </p>\n        {import.meta.env.DEV && (\n          <pre className=\"text-left text-xs bg-muted p-4 rounded mb-4 overflow-auto\">\n            {error.message}\n          </pre>\n        )}\n        <Button onClick={resetErrorBoundary}>\n          Try Again\n        </Button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function ErrorBoundary({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <Sentry.ErrorBoundary\n      fallback={({ error, resetError }) => (\n        <FallbackComponent error={error} resetErrorBoundary={resetError} />\n      )}\n      onError={(error) => {\n        console.error('ErrorBoundary caught:', error);\n      }}\n    >\n      {children}\n    </Sentry.ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Usage in App.tsx:**\n```typescript\nimport { ErrorBoundary } from '@/components/ErrorBoundary';\nimport { Toaster } from '@/components/ui';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary>\n      {/* ... app content */}\n      <Toaster position=\"top-right\" />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### GitHub Actions Workflow\n\n**Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:**\n```yaml\nname: CI\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [main]\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n\njobs:\n  lint-and-typecheck:\n    name: Lint & Type Check\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Setup Node.js\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: '20'\n          cache: 'npm'\n\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: npm ci\n\n      - name: Run lint\n        run: npm run lint\n\n      - name: Run type check\n        run: npm run type-check\n\n      - name: Run build\n        run: npm run build\n```\n\n**Add Type-Check Script to `package.json`:**\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"vite\",\n    \"build\": \"tsc -b && vite build\",\n    \"lint\": \"eslint .\",\n    \"type-check\": \"tsc --noEmit\",\n    \"preview\": \"vite preview\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\n\n**Update `.env.example`:**\n```bash\n# Supabase\nVITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co\nVITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key\n\n# Sentry (Error Tracking)\nVITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-dsn@sentry.io/project-id\n```\n\n**Environment Variable Setup:**\n\n| Variable | Where to Set | Required |\n|----------|--------------|----------|\n| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Vercel + .env.local | Yes |\n| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Vercel + .env.local | Yes |\n| `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` | Vercel only (optional local) | Production only |\n\n**Note:** Service-role keys and API keys for Edge Functions are NOT needed for this story. They will be added in later epics when Edge Functions are implemented.\n\n### Sentry Project Setup (Manual)\n\n1. Create Sentry account at https://sentry.io (free tier available)\n2. Create new project: Select \"React\" platform\n3. Copy the DSN from project settings\n4. Add DSN to Vercel environment variables\n\n### Testing Sentry Integration\n\n**After setup, test error capture:**\n```typescript\n// Temporary test - remove after verification\nfunction TestComponent() {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => {\n      throw new Error('Test Sentry error capture');\n    }}>\n      Test Sentry\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Verify in Sentry dashboard:**\n1. Error appears with stack trace\n2. Environment tag shows \"production\"\n3. Error grouping works correctly\n\n### Build Verification Checklist\n\nBefore marking complete:\n- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds without errors\n- [ ] `npm run lint` passes (0 errors)\n- [ ] `npm run type-check` passes (0 errors)\n- [ ] Local dev server starts without errors\n- [ ] Sentry initializes without console errors (in dev, logs \"Sentry not initialized - no DSN\")\n\n### References\n\n- [Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#Infrastructure & Deployment]\n- [Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#Monitoring]\n- [Source: epic-1-project-foundation-core-infrastructure.md#Story 1.5]\n- [Sentry React SDK Docs: https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/]\n- [Vercel Vite Deployment: https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/vite]\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n- Type error in ErrorBoundary.tsx (error: unknown) - fixed by linter auto-correction\n- All validations pass: lint (0 errors), type-check, build\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Created vercel.json with Vite framework config and SPA rewrites\n- Installed @sentry/react v10.32.1\n- Created src/lib/sentry.ts with production-only initialization\n- Created src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx with Sentry integration and fallback UI\n- Created src/components/index.ts to export ErrorBoundary\n- Created .github/workflows/ci.yml with lint, type-check, build steps\n- Added type-check script to package.json\n- Updated .env.example with VITE_SENTRY_DSN example\n- Updated src/lib/index.ts with Sentry exports\n- Updated src/main.tsx to call initSentry() before render\n- Wrapped App with ErrorBoundary\n- Updated PROJECT_INDEX.md with CI/CD section\n\n### Change Log\n\n| Date | Change | Files |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| 2026-01-12 | Implemented CI/CD & Environment Configuration | See File List |\n\n### File List\n\n**New Files:**\n- vercel.json\n- .github/workflows/ci.yml\n- src/lib/sentry.ts\n- src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx\n- src/components/index.ts\n\n**Modified Files:**\n- .env.example (updated VITE_SENTRY_DSN format)\n- package.json (added type-check script, @sentry/react dependency)\n- src/lib/index.ts (added sentry exports)\n- src/main.tsx (added initSentry call)\n- src/App.tsx (wrapped with ErrorBoundary)\n- PROJECT_INDEX.md (added CI/CD section)\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read this FIRST before any implementation work._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n| Category | Technology | Version |\n|----------|------------|---------|\n| Framework | React | 19 |\n| Build | Vite | 6+ |\n| Language | TypeScript | Strict mode |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS | v4 |\n| Components | shadcn/ui | Latest |\n| Backend | Supabase | Auth + PostgreSQL + Edge Functions |\n| Server State | TanStack Query | Latest |\n| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod | Latest |\n| Routing | React Router DOM | v6+ |\n| Monitoring | Sentry | Latest |\n\n**External Services:**\n- Bunny Stream (video storage/streaming)\n- Bunny Storage (photos/assets)\n- Brevo (transactional email)\n\n---\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Feature Architecture (MOST IMPORTANT)\n\n**Mandatory Index Files:**\n```typescript\n// Every feature folder MUST have index.ts exporting ALL contents\n// features/submissions/index.ts\n\n// === Components ===\nexport { UploadProgress } from './components/UploadProgress';\nexport { SubmissionCard } from './components/SubmissionCard';\n\n// === Hooks ===\nexport { useSubmissions } from './hooks/useSubmissions';\n\n// === API ===\nexport { submissionsApi } from './api/submissionsApi';\n\n// === Types ===\nexport type { Submission, SubmissionStatus } from './types/submission.types';\n```\n\n**Import Rules:**\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Always import from feature index\nimport { UploadProgress, useSubmissions } from '@/features/submissions';\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Never import from deep paths\nimport { UploadProgress } from '@/features/submissions/components/UploadProgress';\n```\n\n**After Creating Any New File:**\n1. Add export to the feature's `index.ts` immediately\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding new features or major components\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\n| Context | Convention | Example |\n|---------|------------|---------|\n| Database tables | snake_case, plural | `participants`, `contest_codes` |\n| Database columns | snake_case | `created_at`, `contest_id` |\n| TypeScript files | PascalCase (components), camelCase (utils) | `RatingScale.tsx`, `submissionsApi.ts` |\n| Functions/variables | camelCase | `getContests`, `isLoading` |\n| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE | `MAX_FILE_SIZE` |\n| Types/Interfaces | PascalCase | `Contest`, `SubmissionStatus` |\n| Hooks | use + PascalCase | `useContests`, `useFileUpload` |\n\n**Data Transformation:**\n- Database returns `snake_case` → Transform to `camelCase` in API layer\n- Never mix conventions within same layer\n\n### State Management Rules\n\n| State Type | Solution | Location |\n|------------|----------|----------|\n| Server data | TanStack Query | Feature hooks |\n| Form data | React Hook Form | Component-local |\n| Auth state | React Context | `AuthContext` |\n| Participant session | React Context | `ParticipantSessionContext` |\n| Local UI | useState | Component-local |\n\n**Never:**\n- Use useState for server data (use TanStack Query)\n- Create global state for form data\n- Mix state management solutions for same concern\n\n### Authentication Rules\n\n**Three Separate Auth Flows:**\n\n| Role | Method | Implementation |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| Admin | Email + Password | Supabase Auth |\n| Judge | Email + Password | Supabase Auth (invite flow) |\n| Participant | Contest Code + Participant Code | localStorage (NO Supabase account) |\n\n**Participant Session:**\n- Store codes in localStorage with `last_activity` timestamp\n- Expire after **120 minutes** of inactivity\n- Active upload keeps session alive\n- Clear on logout (shared device reminder)\n\n### Bunny Upload Security (CRITICAL)\n\n**Never expose Bunny credentials to client.**\n\n**Upload Flow:**\n1. Client requests signed URL from Edge Function\n2. Edge Function validates: participant codes, category open, within limits\n3. Edge Function returns short-lived signed URL\n4. Client uploads directly to Bunny using signed URL\n\n**Storage Path Pattern:**\n```\n/{contest_id}/{category_id}/{participant_code}/{filename}\n```\n\n### Anonymous Judging Rules\n\n**Judge queries must NEVER access participant PII.**\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Judge view query\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('id, media_url, participant_id')  // participant_id is UUID, not PII\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Joins to participant data\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('*, participants(name, organization)')  // EXPOSES PII\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\n**Use Standardized Error Codes:**\n```typescript\nimport { ERROR_CODES } from '@/lib/errorCodes';\n\n// Always use predefined codes\nthrow new AppError(ERROR_CODES.CATEGORY_CLOSED, 'Category deadline has passed');\n```\n\n**Error Codes Available:**\n- `INVALID_CODES`, `SESSION_EXPIRED`, `CONTEST_NOT_FOUND`\n- `CATEGORY_CLOSED`, `SUBMISSION_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`\n- `FILE_TOO_LARGE`, `INVALID_FILE_TYPE`\n- `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `SERVER_ERROR`\n\n### Component Structure\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Imports (React first, then external, then internal)\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui';\nimport { useContests } from '@/features/contests';\n\n// 2. Types (interface for props)\ninterface ContestCardProps {\n  contest: Contest;\n  onSelect: (id: string) => void;\n}\n\n// 3. Component (named export, not default)\nexport function ContestCard({ contest, onSelect }: ContestCardProps) {\n  // hooks first\n  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);\n\n  // handlers\n  const handleClick = () => onSelect(contest.id);\n\n  // render\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n**Co-locate tests with source:**\n```\nfeatures/submissions/components/\n├── UploadProgress.tsx\n├── UploadProgress.test.tsx  ← Same folder\n```\n\n**Test Naming:**\n- Unit tests: `{ComponentName}.test.tsx`\n- Integration tests: `{feature}.integration.test.ts`\n\n### Zod Schema Rules\n\n**Single Source of Truth:**\n```typescript\n// Define schema in types/ folder\n// features/contests/types/contest.schemas.ts\nexport const contestFormSchema = z.object({\n  name: z.string().min(1, 'Required'),\n  contestCode: z.string().length(6, 'Must be 6 digits'),\n});\n\n// Use in form AND API validation\n```\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)\n\n1. **Never import from deep paths** — Always use feature index\n2. **Never use useState for server data** — Use TanStack Query\n3. **Never expose Bunny credentials to client** — Use Edge Functions\n4. **Never join participant PII in judge queries** — Anonymous judging\n5. **Never skip index.ts updates** — Every export must be indexed\n6. **Never mix naming conventions** — snake_case DB, camelCase code\n7. **Never store participant passwords** — Code-only access\n8. **Never use default exports** — Named exports only\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n**Before implementing any feature:**\n1. Read `PROJECT_INDEX.md` at project root\n2. Read the feature's `index.ts` to understand existing exports\n3. Check architecture.md for patterns\n\n**After implementing:**\n1. Update feature's `index.ts` with new exports\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding major components\n3. Run type-check and lint before committing\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\n---\n\n_Last Updated: 2026-01-10_\n"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read `PROJECT_INDEX.md` at project root\n2. Understand all features, contexts, and edge functions that exist\n\n**Before modifying a feature:**\n1. Read `features/{feature}/index.ts` completely\n2. Understand all exports before making changes\n3. Check for related tests (co-located with source)\n\n**After adding new files:**\n1. Add export to the relevant `index.ts` immediately\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding new features, contexts, edge functions, or major components\n\n**After removing files:**\n1. Remove export from the relevant `index.ts`\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if removing features or major components\n\n**NEVER:**\n- Create files without adding to index\n- Delete files without removing from index\n- Import from deep paths (always use index exports)\n- Modify files without first reading the feature's index\n\n## Requirements to Structure Mapping\n\n| Feature Area | Primary Location | Related Files |\n|--------------|------------------|---------------|\n| FR1-FR5: Auth | `features/auth/` | `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` |\n| FR6-FR14: Contests | `features/contests/` | `pages/admin/ContestDetailPage.tsx` |\n| FR15-FR19: Participant Codes | `features/participants/` | `pages/admin/ParticipantCodesPage.tsx` |\n| FR20-FR24: Judge Management | `features/auth/`, `features/categories/` | `supabase/functions/send-notification/` |\n| FR25-FR37: Submissions | `features/submissions/` | `supabase/functions/generate-upload-url/` |\n| FR38-FR48: Judging | `features/reviews/`, `features/rankings/` | `pages/judge/ReviewPage.tsx` |\n| FR49-FR53: Admin Override | `features/reviews/`, `features/rankings/` | `pages/admin/SubmissionsPage.tsx` |\n| FR54-FR60: Winners | `features/rankings/` | `pages/public/WinnersPage.tsx` |\n| FR61-FR64: Notifications | `features/notifications/` | `supabase/functions/send-notification/` |\n\n## Architectural Boundaries\n\n**Import Rules:**\n\n| Layer | Can Import From | Cannot Import From |\n|-------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| `pages/` | `features/` (via index), `components/ui/`, `contexts/`, `lib/` | Other pages directly |\n| `features/*/components/` | `components/ui/`, own feature's hooks/types | Other features (use index) |\n| `features/*/hooks/` | Own feature's api/types, `lib/` | Components |\n| `components/ui/` | `lib/utils.ts` only | Features, pages, contexts |\n\n**Data Flow:**\n\n| Data Type | Managed By | Accessed Via |\n|-----------|------------|--------------|\n| Server data | TanStack Query | Feature hooks |\n| Auth state | AuthContext | `useAuth()` |\n| Participant session | ParticipantSessionContext | `useParticipantSession()` |\n| Form data | React Hook Form | Component-local |\n\n## External Integration Points\n\n| Service | Integration File | Purpose |\n|---------|------------------|---------|\n| Supabase Auth | `lib/supabase.ts`, `features/auth/` | Admin/Judge authentication |\n| Supabase DB | `lib/supabase.ts`, feature API files | All data operations |\n| Bunny Stream | `supabase/functions/generate-upload-url/` | Video upload URLs |\n| Bunny Storage | `supabase/functions/generate-upload-url/` | Photo upload URLs |\n| Brevo | `supabase/functions/send-notification/` | Email notifications |\n| Sentry | `lib/sentry.ts` | Error tracking |\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The platform serves three distinct user types — each should feel like it was purpose-built for them. Built with a modern, sleek aesthetic inspired by Linear, shadcn/ui, Untitled UI, and Stripe.\n\n## Target Users\n\n| User | Tech Comfort | Primary Emotion | UX Priority |\n|------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| **Jeb (Super Admin)** | High | \"I need control without overwhelm\" | Dashboard clarity, batch operations, zero guesswork |\n| **Judges** | Low | \"Just tell me what to do\" | Pristine simplicity, obvious progress, one-thing-at-a-time |\n| **Participants** | High | \"Will this work? Please work.\" | Upload confidence, deadline assurance, clear confirmation |\n| **T/L/C** | Irrelevant | \"Don't make me log in\" | Email-only interaction |\n\n## Key Design Challenges\n\n1. **The Judge Paradox** — Domain experts who are NOT tech-savvy. Interface must feel so obvious that reluctant judges think \"that was... actually fine\" after their first session. Zero learning curve.\n\n2. **Deadline Crunch Anxiety** — Participants uploading large videos minutes before deadline need absolute confidence. Progress indicators must be butter-smooth, confirmation unmistakable.\n\n3. **Anonymous-to-Revealed Transition** — Judges see only codes during review, but Admin sees everything. Admin view must surface participant data without breaking the mental model of anonymous judging.\n\n4. **Multi-Role, Single Platform** — Three distinct experiences sharing one codebase. Each role should feel purpose-built, not compromised.\n\n## Design Opportunities\n\n1. **Visual Sophistication** — Linear-inspired visual language: subtle gradients, refined typography, generous whitespace, premium \"this feels expensive\" quality across all screens.\n\n2. **Progress-as-Delight** — Judge progress bars that feel satisfying to fill. Subtle dopamine hit at completion with clean completion states.\n\n3. **Upload Confidence Theater** — Make upload experience feel expensive. Smooth progress, processing states, preview before submit, unmistakable confirmation.\n\n4. **Contextual Density** — Admin dashboard can be data-rich; Judge view should be zen-minimal. Same design system, different information density per role.\n"}}

What's next? Am I done?\n3. **Desktop-First, Responsive Always** — Optimize for laptop workflows, never break on mobile\n4. **Reliability is UX** — Technical performance IS the user experience\n5. **Role-Appropriate Density** — Same design system, right information density per context\n"}}

This is the highest-stakes moment — Sofia at 11:59 PM, racing the deadline, needing absolute confidence that her work is safe.\n\nIf we nail this moment, everything else follows:\n- Participants trust the platform\n- Jeb doesn't get \"did my upload work?\" emails\n- The product earns word-of-mouth recommendations\n\n## User Mental Model\n\n**What participants expect:**\n- Progress that feels real (not fake progress bars)\n- Clear feedback at every stage\n- Ability to preview before final submit\n- Unmistakable confirmation when done\n- Graceful handling if something goes wrong\n\n**Current frustrations with uploads:**\n- Vague progress indicators\n- No idea if it's working or frozen\n- Unclear error messages when something fails\n- Anxiety about whether it actually went through\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n| Criteria | Target |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Confidence** | User never wonders \"is it working?\" |\n| **Progress clarity** | Percentage + speed + time remaining visible |\n| **Deadline fairness** | Timestamp captured at upload START, not completion |\n| **Completion certainty** | Unmistakable confirmation with timestamp |\n| **Verification** | Preview before final submit |\n\n## Submission Timestamp Logic (CRITICAL)\n\nTo protect participants with slow connections during deadline crunch:\n\n| Event | Timestamp Behavior |\n|-------|-------------------|\n| Upload starts at 11:59 PM | Timestamp **locks** at 11:59 PM |\n| Upload completes at 12:03 AM | Grace period begins (10-15 minutes) |\n| Submit clicked within grace period | Submission time = **11:59 PM** (protected) |\n| Submit clicked after grace period expires | Submission time = **actual click time** (late) |\n\n**UX Implications:**\n- Show locked timestamp prominently during upload: \"Your submission time: 11:59 PM\"\n- After upload completes, show countdown: \"Submit within 14:32 to keep your 11:59 PM timestamp\"\n- If grace period expires, update messaging: \"Your submission time will be when you click Submit\"\n\n## Experience Mechanics\n\n**Stage 1: Initiation**\n- Generous drag-and-drop zone (not a tiny button)\n- File specs visible: \"Up to 500MB • MP4, MOV, WebM\"\n- Instant validation before upload begins (format, size)\n- Click-to-browse as fallback\n\n**Stage 2: Upload Progress**\n- **Timestamp locks when upload starts** — display prominently\n- Smooth progress bar (no jumps or freezes)\n- Real metrics: \"67% • 2.3 MB/s • ~45 seconds remaining\"\n- Connection quality indicator\n- Cancel option always visible\n\n**Stage 3: Processing**\n- \"Processing video...\" state after upload completes\n- Explain what's happening: \"Preparing your video for playback...\"\n- Show processing progress if available from Bunny\n- Grace period countdown begins\n\n**Stage 4: Preview**\n- Thumbnail generated and displayed\n- Play button to verify correct file\n- File details visible (duration, size)\n- Grace period countdown visible: \"Submit within 12:45 to lock your 11:59 PM time\"\n\n**Stage 5: Confirmation**\n- Big submit button: \"Submit to [Category Name]\"\n- Post-submit confirmation screen:\n  - Green checkmark, unmistakable success\n  - \"Submitted at 11:59 PM — before the 12:00 AM deadline\"\n  - Submission reference code\n  - \"You can edit until [deadline]\" if applicable\n  - Screenshot-worthy for Sofia to send to her coach\n\n**Error Handling**\n- Connection slow: \"Upload continuing... connection is slow but stable\"\n- Connection lost: \"Connection interrupted. [Try again]\" (resumable upload if Bunny supports it — verify during implementation)\n- File rejected: Specific reason + what to do (\"File is 520MB. Maximum is 500MB. [Choose different file]\")\n- Server error: \"Something went wrong on our end. [Try again] — your file is safe locally\"\n\n## Pattern Classification\n\n**Established patterns we're using:**\n- Drag-and-drop upload (Dropbox, Google Drive)\n- Progress bar with real metrics (WeTransfer)\n- Preview before submit (YouTube)\n- Confirmation with timestamp (form submissions)\n\n**Our refinements:**\n- Timestamp locks at upload START (deadline fairness)\n- Grace period with visible countdown\n- \"Deadline-aware\" messaging throughout\n- Screenshot-worthy confirmation (Sofia texts her coach)\n\n**Implementation Notes:**\n- Resumable uploads: Verify if Bunny supports this; if not, design graceful retry\n- Grace period duration: Recommend 10-15 minutes, confirm with Jeb\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
