Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`#L432) - FIXED: Source files now show in git status after review fixes\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] `LoginForm` tests render without `AuthProvider`, so `useAuth()` throws. (`src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.tsx`#L28, `src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.test.tsx`#L24) - FIXED: Tests now wrap in AuthContext.Provider with mock value\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Deep imports bypass feature index exports (violates project rules). (`src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx`#L4, `src/pages/auth/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx`#L2, `src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`#L3, `src/router/index.tsx`#L11) - FIXED: All imports now use feature index exports\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] AC6 says redirect to `/judge`, but code redirects to `/judge/dashboard`. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`#L42, `src/router/AdminRoute.tsx`#L48) - FIXED: AdminRoute now redirects to /judge\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Uncommitted `.codex` changes not documented in File List. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`#L432) - RESOLVED: .codex files are not part of implementation artifacts\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] React namespace usage violates project rules in tests. (`src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.test.tsx`#L12) - FIXED: Changed React.ReactNode to import type { ReactNode }\n- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] AC2 requires exact error text; error message includes a trailing period. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`#L20, `src/lib/errorCodes.ts`#L35) - FIXED: Removed trailing period from error message\n- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Process Failure: Work Not Staged or Committed. Files created/modified but not `git add`ed. (All 24 files listed in \"File List\")\n- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] AC6: Judge Role Redirect (AC6) points to `/judge` instead of `/judge/dashboard`. (`src/router/AdminRoute.tsx`, Line 48)\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Architectural Flaw: Redundant `isLoading` State. `LoginForm.tsx` has local `isLoading` instead of using `useAuth`'s. (`src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.tsx`, Line 28)\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Architectural Flaw: Inconsistent API Exports in `authApi.ts`. Exports individual functions AND a bundled object. (`src/features/auth/api/authApi.ts`, Lines 28-135)\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Missing Requirement: Manual Tests Not Performed. Task 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 are unchecked. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`) - COMPLETED: All manual tests pass (2026-01-12)\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Missing Requirement: Error Codes Not Used. `authApi.ts` throws generic strings instead of `ERROR_CODES`. (`src/features/auth/api/authApi.ts`, Lines 40, 44, 57, 69, 83, 97)\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Missing File: `src/pages/judge/DashboardPage.tsx` Placeholder. File exists at `src/pages/judge/DashboardPage.tsx`.\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Inefficient Data Fetching. `AuthProvider.tsx` calls `fetchUserProfile` on `TOKEN_REFRESHED`. (`src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`, Line 61 - removed)\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Missing Exports in `index.ts` files. All exports verified complete in `src/features/auth/index.ts`, `src/pages/index.ts`, `src/contexts/index.ts`.\n- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Redundant `isAuthenticated` Memoization in `AuthProvider.tsx`. (`src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`, Line 102 - now computed inline)\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Story 2.1 scope includes admin layout, contests placeholder, and RLS migration not in Tasks/ACs. (`src/features/admin/components/AdminLayout.tsx`#L1) - RESOLVED: Story 2.2 (Admin Layout) was implemented during Story 2.1 code review iterations. All Story 2.2 work is completed, tested (9 tests pass), committed in this branch, and documented in 2-2-admin-layout-dashboard-shell.md. RLS migration (is_admin function) was necessary fix for AC5-AC7 to work correctly. \n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] React namespace usage in UI primitives violates project rules. (`src/components/ui/avatar.tsx`#L1) - RESOLVED: Added exception to project-context.md for shadcn/ui components. These are auto-generated by shadcn CLI and use their canonical React namespace style (9 files). Project rule applies to features/, pages/, contexts/, router/, lib/ only.\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Missing tests for auth state and route protection (AC5–AC7). (`src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`#L1) - RESOLVED: Created comprehensive test files (AuthProvider.test.tsx - 10 tests, AdminRoute.test.tsx - 5 tests, ProtectedRoute.test.tsx - 5 tests). All 56 project tests pass. Tests cover: initial state, signIn/signOut, session subscription, loading states, unauthenticated redirects (AC5), judge role redirects (AC6), admin access.\n- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] `ForgotPasswordPage` rethrows errors; no catch in form leads to unhandled rejection noise. (`src/pages/auth/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx`#L11) - RESOLVED: Added catch block in ForgotPasswordForm.tsx to handle rethrown errors gracefully. Form now properly prevents success state on error without unhandled rejection noise.\n- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] React namespace type usage remains in router tests (violates project rule). Possible fix: replace `React.ReactNode` with `type ReactNode` import from `react` and use `children: ReactNode` in both files. (`src/router/AdminRoute.test.tsx`#L33, `src/router/ProtectedRoute.test.tsx`#L33) - FIXED: Added `import { type ReactNode } from 'react'` and changed `children: React.ReactNode` to `children: ReactNode` in both test files\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] AC6 says redirect to `/judge`, but `/judge` immediately redirects to `/judge/dashboard`, so effective destination does not match AC text. Decide desired target and align AC or routing. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`#L45, `src/router/index.tsx`#L46) - RESOLVED: Updated AC6 text to say \"(/judge/dashboard)\" to accurately reflect the effective destination after routing\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n\n### Database Already Set Up\n\nThe profiles table and auth trigger already exist from Epic 1 (Story 1-2):\n- `profiles` table with id, email, role ('admin' | 'judge'), first_name, last_name\n- Role protection trigger prevents users from changing their own role\n- New users default to 'judge' role (admin must be set manually in DB)\n\n**To create a Super Admin for testing:**\n```sql\n-- After signing up via Supabase Auth, update role to admin\nUPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';\n```\n\n### Auth Flow Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                        Auth Flow                                 │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  1.

Contact administrator\" text (no self-signup for admins)\n\n**ForgotPasswordForm.tsx:**\n- Email field only\n- Success message: \"Check your email for reset instructions\"\n- Link back to login\n\n**ResetPasswordPage.tsx:**\n- Handles Supabase password reset callback\n- New password + confirm password fields\n- Success redirects to login with toast\n\n### Protected Route Pattern\n\n```typescript\n// AdminRoute.tsx\nexport function AdminRoute({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const { user, isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();\n  const location = useLocation();\n\n  if (isLoading) {\n    return <LoadingScreen />;\n  }\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return <Navigate to=\"/login\" state={{ from: location }} replace />;\n  }\n\n  if (user?.role !== 'admin') {\n    // Judge trying to access admin routes\n    return <Navigate to=\"/judge\" replace />;\n  }\n\n  return <>{children}</>;\n}\n```\n\n### Route Configuration\n\n```typescript\n// router/index.tsx\nconst router = createBrowserRouter([\n  // Public routes\n  { path: '/login', element: <LoginPage /> },\n  { path: '/forgot-password', element: <ForgotPasswordPage /> },\n  { path: '/reset-password', element: <ResetPasswordPage /> },\n\n  // Admin routes (protected)\n  {\n    path: '/admin',\n    element: <AdminRoute><AdminLayout /></AdminRoute>,\n    children: [\n      { index: true, element: <Navigate to=\"/admin/dashboard\" replace /> },\n      { path: 'dashboard', element: <DashboardPage /> },\n      // More admin routes added in Story 2.2+\n    ],\n  },\n\n  // Judge routes (protected) - placeholder for Epic 3\n  {\n    path: '/judge',\n    element: <JudgeRoute><JudgeLayout /></JudgeRoute>,\n    children: [\n      { index: true, element: <Navigate to=\"/judge/dashboard\" replace /> },\n      { path: 'dashboard', element: <JudgeDashboardPlaceholder /> },\n    ],\n  },\n\n  // Default redirect\n  { path: '/', element: <Navigate to=\"/login\" replace /> },\n  { path: '*', element: <NotFoundPage /> },\n]);\n```\n\n### Styling Notes\n\n- Use shadcn/ui Card for login form container\n- Match Untitled UI neutral color scheme (already configured)\n- Responsive: mobile-first, max-width on form\n- Skeleton loading state while checking auth\n\n### Error Handling\n\nUse standardized error codes from `lib/errorCodes.ts`:\n```typescript\n// Add these error codes if not present\nexport const ERROR_CODES = {\n  // ... existing codes\n  AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS: 'AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS',\n  AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED: 'AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED',\n  AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED: 'AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED',\n} as const;\n```\n\n### Testing Notes\n\n**Unit Tests (LoginForm.test.tsx):**\n- Renders email and password fields\n- Shows validation errors for empty fields\n- Shows validation errors for invalid email format\n- Calls onSubmit with valid data\n- Disables submit button while loading\n\n**Manual Testing Checklist:**\n1. Create admin user in Supabase Dashboard\n2. Update role to 'admin' in profiles table\n3. Test login with correct credentials → redirects to /admin/dashboard\n4. Test login with wrong password → shows error toast\n5. Test login with non-existent email → shows error toast\n6. Test /admin/* access when logged out → redirects to /login\n7. Test password reset email is sent\n8. Test logout clears session and redirects\n\n### Previous Story Learnings Applied\n\nFrom Epic 1:\n- All imports from feature index, never deep paths\n- Named exports only, no default exports\n- Toast for user feedback: `toast.error()`, `toast.success()`\n- React Hook Form + Zod for all forms\n- TanStack Query for server state (not needed here - auth uses Supabase client directly)\n- Update index.ts immediately after creating new files\n- Update PROJECT_INDEX.md with new components\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n1. **Password hashing**: Handled by Supabase Auth (bcrypt)\n2. **Session tokens**: Stored in localStorage by Supabase (JWT)\n3. **Role enforcement**: RLS policies + frontend route guards\n4. **No role in JWT claims**: Always fetch from profiles table (prevents token manipulation)\n5. **HTTPS only**: Enforced by Vercel deployment\n\n### References\n\n- [Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#Authentication & Security]\n- [Source: prd/functional-requirements.md#FR1, FR4]\n- [Source: epic-2-super-admin-authentication-contest-management.md#Story 2.1]\n- [Source: ux-design/user-journey-flows.md#Flow 3: Admin Contest Creation]\n- [Source: project-context.md#Authentication Rules]\n- [Supabase Auth Docs: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth]\n- [React Router Protected Routes: https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial#authenticated-routes]\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\nN/A\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Implemented full auth context with Supabase integration (AuthContext, AuthProvider, useAuth hook)\n- Created LoginForm with React Hook Form + Zod validation (mode: 'onBlur' for inline validation)\n- Created ForgotPasswordForm and ResetPasswordPage for password recovery flow\n- Created ProtectedRoute, AdminRoute, JudgeRoute for role-based access control\n- AdminRoute redirects judges to /judge/dashboard, unauthenticated users to /login\n- Created placeholder admin and judge dashboard pages\n- Added auth error codes (AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS, AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED, AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED)\n- All unit tests pass (10 tests in LoginForm.test.tsx)\n- Build, lint, and type-check all pass\n- **CRITICAL FIX: RLS Policy Infinite Recursion** -

✓ All 56 tests pass (10 LoginForm + 10 AuthProvider + 5 AdminRoute + 5 ProtectedRoute + 9 AdminSidebar + 17 examples)\n- **THIRD CODE REVIEW FOLLOW-UPS RESOLVED** (2026-01-12):\n  - ✓ Item 1 [CRITICAL]: Fixed React namespace usage in router tests (AdminRoute.test.tsx, ProtectedRoute.test.tsx) - Changed `React.ReactNode` to `import { type ReactNode } from 'react'` and `children: ReactNode`\n  - ✓ Item 2 [MEDIUM]: Updated AC6 to say \"(/judge/dashboard)\" instead of \"(/judge)\" to accurately reflect effective destination after routing\n  - ✓ All 56 tests still pass after fixes\n\n### Change Log\n\n| Date | Change | Files |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| 2026-01-12 | Implemented Story 2.1 Super Admin Login | See File List below |\n\n### File List\n\n**New Files:**\n- src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx\n- src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx\n- src/contexts/AuthProvider.test.tsx\n- src/features/auth/api/authApi.ts\n- src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.tsx\n- src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.test.tsx\n- src/features/auth/components/ForgotPasswordForm.tsx\n- src/features/auth/types/auth.types.ts\n- src/features/auth/types/auth.schemas.ts\n- src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx\n- src/pages/auth/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx\n- src/pages/auth/ResetPasswordPage.tsx\n- src/pages/admin/DashboardPage.tsx\n- src/pages/judge/DashboardPage.tsx\n- src/router/ProtectedRoute.tsx\n- src/router/ProtectedRoute.test.tsx\n- src/router/AdminRoute.tsx\n- src/router/AdminRoute.test.tsx\n- src/router/JudgeRoute.tsx\n\n**Modified Files:**\n- PROJECT_INDEX.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml\n- _bmad-output/project-context.md\n- src/contexts/index.ts\n- src/features/auth/index.ts\n- src/features/auth/components/ForgotPasswordForm.tsx\n- src/lib/errorCodes.ts\n- src/main.tsx\n- src/pages/index.ts\n- src/router/index.tsx\n"}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

closed categories (Story 7.2)\n\n**Given** a contest status changes to \"Finished\"\n**And** the T/L/C notification toggle is ON\n**When** the system prepares to send T/L/C emails\n**Then** it collects ALL unique T/L/C emails across all participants in the contest\n**And** sends exactly ONE email per unique T/L/C email address\n\n**Given** multiple participants have the same T/L/C email\n**When** the notification is sent\n**Then** that T/L/C receives only ONE email (deduplicated)\n**And** the email does NOT list individual participant codes\n\n**Given** T/L/C receives the email\n**When** they read it\n**Then** they see:\n- Subject: \"Contest Results Available: {Contest Name}\"\n- Generic message that results are available\n- NO direct link to winners page (admin shares manually)\n- Message: \"Contact your participants for their individual feedback\"\n\n**Given** T/L/C notification is optional\n**When** admin configures contest\n**Then** there is a toggle: \"Notify T/L/C when results published\"\n**And** default is OFF\n\n**Given** email delivery fails\n**When** error occurs\n**Then** it is logged\n**And** admin can see failed notifications in contest dashboard\n\n**Requirements:** FR63, FR64\n\n---\n\n## Story 7.5: Email Delivery Tracking & Retry\n\nAs a **Super Admin**,\nI want **to view email delivery status and retry failed emails**,\nSo that **I can ensure all stakeholders receive notifications**.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** I am on a contest dashboard\n**When** I view the notifications section\n**Then** I see a summary:\n- Total emails sent\n- Successful deliveries\n- Failed deliveries\n- Pending retries\n\n**Given** I want to see details\n**When** I click \"View All Notifications\"\n**Then** I see a table:\n| Recipient | Type | Status | Sent At | Actions |\n\n**Given** an email has failed status\n**When** I view it\n**Then** I see the error message\n**And** I see a \"Retry\" button\n\n**Given** I click \"Retry\"\n**When** the retry processes\n**Then** a new send attempt is made\n**And** the status updates to \"sent\" or remains \"failed\"\n**And** retry count is incremented\n\n**Given** an email fails 3 times\n**When** the third failure occurs\n**Then** it is marked \"permanently_failed\"\n**And** no automatic retries occur\n**And** admin must manually intervene\n\n**Given** I view email logs\n**When** I filter by type\n**Then** I can filter by:\n- Judge invitations\n- Completion notifications\n- T/L/C notifications\n\n**Given** I want to export logs\n**When** I click \"Export\"\n**Then** I download a CSV of notification history\n\n**Requirements:** NFR26\n\n---\n\n--- _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics/epic-list.md ---\n# Epic List\n\n## Epic 1: Project

Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding new features or major components\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\n| Context | Convention | Example |\n|---------|------------|---------|\n| Database tables | snake_case, plural | `participants`, `contest_codes` |\n| Database columns | snake_case | `created_at`, `contest_id` |\n| TypeScript files | PascalCase (components), camelCase (utils) | `RatingScale.tsx`, `submissionsApi.ts` |\n| Functions/variables | camelCase | `getContests`, `isLoading` |\n| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE | `MAX_FILE_SIZE` |\n| Types/Interfaces | PascalCase | `Contest`, `SubmissionStatus` |\n| Hooks | use + PascalCase | `useContests`, `useFileUpload` |\n\n**Data Transformation:**\n- Database returns `snake_case` → Transform to `camelCase` in API layer\n- Never mix conventions within same layer\n\n### State Management Rules\n\n| State Type | Solution | Location |\n|------------|----------|----------|\n| Server data | TanStack Query | Feature hooks |\n| Form data | React Hook Form | Component-local |\n| Auth state | React Context | `AuthContext` |\n| Participant session | React Context | `ParticipantSessionContext` |\n| Local UI | useState | Component-local |\n\n**Never:**\n- Use useState for server data (use TanStack Query)\n- Create global state for form data\n- Mix state management solutions for same concern\n\n### Authentication Rules\n\n**Three Separate Auth Flows:**\n\n| Role | Method | Implementation |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| Admin | Email + Password | Supabase Auth |\n| Judge | Email + Password | Supabase Auth (invite flow) |\n| Participant | Contest Code + Participant Code | localStorage (NO Supabase account) |\n\n**Participant Session:**\n- Store codes in localStorage with `last_activity` timestamp\n- Expire after **120 minutes** of inactivity\n- Active upload keeps session alive\n- Clear on logout (shared device reminder)\n\n### Supabase Security Rules (MANDATORY)\n\n**Signup Triggers:**\n- ALWAYS force default role ('judge') in signup triggers\n- NEVER trust user metadata for role assignment (prevents privilege escalation)\n- ALWAYS use `SET search_path = public` in SECURITY DEFINER functions\n\n```sql\n-- CORRECT: Force role, ignore metadata\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()\nRETURNS TRIGGER\nSET search_path = public  -- Prevents search_path hijacking\nAS $$\nBEGIN\n  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email, role)\n  VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.email, 'judge');  -- Always 'judge', never from metadata\n  RETURN NEW;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;\n```\n\n**RLS Policies:**\n- ALWAYS enable RLS on tables with user data\n- NEVER allow users to modify their own role or email via RLS UPDATE policies\n- Use trigger-based column protection for sensitive fields\n\n**Column Protection Pattern:**\n```sql\n-- Trigger to prevent role/email modification\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION protect_sensitive_columns()\nRETURNS TRIGGER AS $$\nBEGIN\n  IF OLD.role IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.role THEN\n    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Cannot modify role column';\n  END IF;\n  IF OLD.email IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.email THEN\n    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Cannot modify email column';\n  END IF;\n  RETURN NEW;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\nCREATE TRIGGER protect_profile_columns\n  BEFORE UPDATE ON profiles\n  FOR EACH ROW\n  EXECUTE FUNCTION protect_sensitive_columns();\n```\n\n**TypeScript Types Must Match:**\n```typescript\n// Exclude protected columns from Update type\nUpdate: {\n  first_name?: string | null;\n  last_name?: string | null;\n  // NO role, NO email, NO id\n};\n```\n\n### Bunny Upload Security (CRITICAL)\n\n**Never expose Bunny credentials to client.**\n\n**Upload Flow:**\n1. Client requests signed URL from Edge Function\n2. Edge Function validates: participant codes, category open, within limits\n3. Edge Function returns short-lived signed URL\n4. Client uploads directly to Bunny using signed URL\n\n**Storage Path Pattern:**\n```\n/{contest_id}/{category_id}/{participant_code}/{filename}\n```\n\n### Anonymous Judging Rules\n\n**Judge queries must NEVER access participant PII.**\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Judge view query\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('id, media_url, participant_id')  // participant_id is UUID, not PII\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Joins to participant data\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('*, participants(name, organization)')  // EXPOSES PII\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\n**Use Standardized Error Codes:**\n```typescript\nimport { ERROR_CODES } from '@/lib/errorCodes';\n\n// Always use predefined codes\nthrow new AppError(ERROR_CODES.CATEGORY_CLOSED, 'Category deadline has passed');\n```\n\n**Error Codes Available:**\n- `INVALID_CODES`, `SESSION_EXPIRED`, `CONTEST_NOT_FOUND`\n- `CATEGORY_CLOSED`, `SUBMISSION_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`\n- `FILE_TOO_LARGE`, `INVALID_FILE_TYPE`\n- `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `SERVER_ERROR`\n\n### React Import Standards\n\n**Always use explicit imports, never React namespace:**\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Explicit type imports\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { type ComponentProps, type HTMLAttributes } from 'react';\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Don't use React namespace\nimport React from 'react';\nconst props: React.ComponentProps<typeof Button>;  // Don't do this\n```\n\n**Type-only imports for types:**\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Use 'type' keyword for type-only imports\nimport { type ReactNode, type FC } from 'react';\n\n// Also acceptable\nimport type { ReactNode, FC } from 'react';\n```\n\n**Exception for shadcn/ui Components:**\n```typescript\n// ✅ ACCEPTABLE - shadcn/ui components in src/components/ui/ use their canonical style\n// These are auto-generated by shadcn CLI and use React namespace imports\n// Example: src/components/ui/avatar.tsx, button.tsx, etc.\nimport * as React from \"react\"\nconst Component = React.forwardRef<React.ElementRef<...>, React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<...>>()\n\n// Project rule applies to: features/, pages/, contexts/, router/, lib/ (NOT src/components/ui/)\n```\n\n### Component Structure\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Imports (React first, then external, then internal)\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { type ComponentProps } from 'react';\nimport { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui';\nimport { useContests } from '@/features/contests';\n\n// 2. Types (interface for props)\ninterface ContestCardProps {\n  contest: Contest;\n  onSelect: (id: string) => void;\n}\n\n// 3. Component (named export, not default)\nexport function ContestCard({ contest, onSelect }: ContestCardProps) {\n  // hooks first\n  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);\n\n  // handlers\n  const handleClick = () => onSelect(contest.id);\n\n  // render\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n**Co-locate tests with source:**\n```\nfeatures/submissions/components/\n├── UploadProgress.tsx\n├── UploadProgress.test.tsx  ← Same folder\n```\n\n**Test Naming:**\n- Unit tests: `{ComponentName}.test.tsx`\n- Integration tests: `{feature}.integration.test.ts`\n\n### Zod Schema Rules\n\n**Single Source of Truth:**\n```typescript\n// Define schema in types/ folder\n// features/contests/types/contest.schemas.ts\nexport const contestFormSchema = z.object({\n  name: z.string().min(1, 'Required'),\n  contestCode: z.string().length(6, 'Must be 6 digits'),\n});\n\n// Use in form AND API validation\n```\n\n### Git Workflow Rules (MANDATORY - ENFORCED BY WORKFLOWS)\n\n**🔥 CRITICAL: Branch discipline is now ENFORCED by dev-story and code-review workflows 🔥**\n\n**Branch-Per-Story (Parallel Development):**\n\nEach story MUST have its own dedicated branch. Multiple stories can be in progress simultaneously on separate branches.\n\n**Branch Naming Convention (EXACT MATCH REQUIRED):**\n```bash\nstory/{story-key}\n\n# The branch name MUST exactly match the story filename (without .md extension)\n# Examples:\nstory/1-4-core-ui-components  # for file: 1-4-core-ui-components.md\nstory/1-5-ci-cd-config        # for file: 1-5-ci-cd-config.md\nstory/2-1-super-admin-login   # for file: 2-1-super-admin-login.md\n```\n\n**Automatic Enforcement:**\n\n**When dev-story workflow runs:**\n1. **Checks if branch `story/{story-key}` exists**\n2. **If exists:** Checks out the branch and continues\n3. **If not exists:** Creates branch from main, checks out, and continues\n4. **Validates:** Confirms you're on correct branch before any code changes\n5. **Before marking \"review\":** Ensures all changes committed and branch pushed to remote\n\n**When code-review workflow runs:**\n1. **REQUIRES branch `story/{story-key}` to exist** - HALTS if missing\n2. **Checks out the story branch** to review actual changes\n3. **After approval (status=done):** Offers to merge branch automatically or create PR\n4. **Commits any review fixes** made during review to the story branch\n\n**Starting a New Story:**\n```bash\n# Dev workflow handles this automatically - no manual branch creation needed!\n# Just run: /dev-story\n\n# Workflow will:\n# - Detect no branch exists for story\n# - Create story/{story-key} from main\n# - Checkout the branch\n# - Begin implementation\n```\n\n**Switching Between Stories:**\n```bash\n# Commit current work before switching\ngit add -A && git commit -m \"{story-id}: WIP - {brief description}\"\ngit checkout story/{other-story-id}\n\n# Or let dev-story handle it - it will checkout correct branch automatically\n```\n\n**Commit Message Format (Auto-Generated by Dev):**\n\nThe Dev agent MUST auto-generate descriptive commit messages following this format:\n\n```\n{story-id}: {action} {what changed}\n\nActions: Add, Update, Fix, Refactor, Remove, Configure, Implement\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n- `1-4: Add Button and Card components`\n- `1-4: Update index.ts with new exports`\n- `1-4: Fix TypeScript errors in form validation`\n- `1-5: Configure Vite environment variables`\n- `2-1: Implement login form with Supabase auth`\n\n**Before Marking Story as \"review\" Status:**\n\n1. Switch to the story's branch\n2. ALL changes for that story must be committed\n3. Branch must be pushed to remote\n4. Working tree must be clean (`git status` shows nothing to commit)\n\n**Pre-Review Checklist (MANDATORY):**\n\nBefore marking any story as \"review\" status, verify ALL items:\n\n```bash\n# Git Status (REQUIRED)\n□ git status          # Must show: \"nothing to commit, working tree clean\"\n□ git log --oneline -5  # Verify commits have story ID prefix\n□ git push -u origin story/{story-id}-{description}  # Push to remote\n\n# Quality Gates (REQUIRED)\n□ npm run build       # Must pass with no errors\n□ npm run lint        # Must pass with no errors\n□ npm run type-check  # Must pass with no errors\n□ npm run test        # Must pass (if tests exist for story)\n\n# Import Compliance (REQUIRED)\n□ grep -r \"from '@/\" src/ | grep -v \"/index'\" | grep -v \"from '@/lib'\" | grep -v \"from '@/components/ui'\"\n  # Should return empty - no deep imports allowed\n\n# Documentation (REQUIRED)\n□ All Acceptance Criteria verified with evidence (test output, screenshots, logs)\n□ File List in story generated from git (see File List Generation below)\n□ Dev Notes updated with any new patterns discovered\n```\n\n**File List Generation (MANDATORY):**\n\nNEVER manually write the File List. Always generate from git:\n\n```bash\n# Run these commands and copy output to story File List section:\n\necho \"**New Files:**\"\ngit status --porcelain | grep \"^??\" | cut -c4- | sed 's/^/- /'\n\necho \"**Modified Files:**\"\ngit status --porcelain | grep \"^ M\\|^M \" | cut -c4- | sed 's/^/- /'\n\necho \"**Deleted Files:**\"\ngit status --porcelain | grep \"^ D\\|^D \" | cut -c4- | sed 's/^/- /'\n```\n\n**Code Review Will Be REJECTED If:**\n- ❌ Story changes are not on a dedicated story branch → **NOW ENFORCED:** code-review HALTS if branch doesn't exist\n- ❌ Uncommitted changes exist on the story branch → **NOW ENFORCED:** dev-story validates before marking \"review\"\n- ❌ Branch is not pushed to remote → **NOW ENFORCED:** dev-story auto-pushes before marking \"review\"\n- ❌ Commit messages don't follow the `{story-id}: {action} {what}` format → Reviewers will flag this\n\n**Branch Enforcement Summary:**\n- ✅ **dev-story workflow:** Automatically creates/checks out correct branch, validates before marking \"review\"\n- ✅ **code-review workflow:** Validates branch exists before review, offers auto-merge after approval\n- ✅ **Parallel development:** Multiple stories can safely run simultaneously on separate branches\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)\n\n1. **Never import from deep paths** — Always use feature index\n2. **Never use useState for server data** — Use TanStack Query\n3. **Never expose Bunny credentials to client** — Use Edge Functions\n4. **Never join participant PII in judge queries** — Anonymous judging\n5. **Never skip index.ts updates** — Every export must be indexed\n6. **Never mix naming conventions** — snake_case DB, camelCase code\n7. **Never store participant passwords** — Code-only access\n8. **Never use default exports** — Named exports only\n9. **Never trust user metadata for role assignment** — Force default role in triggers\n10. **Never manually write File Lists** — Generate from git status\n11. **Never use React namespace (React.ComponentProps)** — Use explicit imports\n12. **Never skip pre-review checklist** — All gates must pass before review\n13. **Never work on wrong branch** — Workflows enforce story/{story-key} branching (auto-created if missing)\n14. **Never mark story \"review\" with uncommitted changes** — Workflow validates and auto-pushes\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n**Before implementing any feature:**\n1. Read `PROJECT_INDEX.md` at project root\n2. Read the feature's `index.ts` to understand existing exports\n3. Check this file (project-context.md) for patterns and rules\n\n**After implementing:**\n1. Update feature's `index.ts` with new exports\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding major components\n3. Run full pre-review checklist before marking \"review\"\n\n**Story File Pattern:**\n- Do NOT duplicate \"Previous Story Learnings\" in story files\n- Reference: `See project-context.md for established patterns`\n- This file is the single source of truth for patterns and rules\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\n---\n\n_Last Updated: 2026-01-12 (Branch Enforcement Added)_\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md#L461`)\n- Untracked `_bmad/_config/ides/github-copilot.yaml` is a repo change not documented in the story File List. (`git status --porcelain`)\n\n## 🟡 MEDIUM ISSUES (AC ALIGNMENT)\n- AC6 in epic doc expects redirect to `/judge`, but actual routing immediately redirects `/judge` → `/judge/dashboard`. Story adjusted AC6 text to `/judge/dashboard`, but epic still conflicts. This is a spec mismatch between story and epic. (`_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics/epic-2-super-admin-authentication-contest-management.md`)\n\n## 🔴 HIGH ISSUES\n- AC7 (Participant session redirect) has no implementation. There is no ParticipantSessionContext, no participant session detection in `AdminRoute`, `ProtectedRoute`, or login flow; AC7 is marked [x] with no code/test evidence. (`src/router/AdminRoute.tsx`, `src/router/ProtectedRoute.tsx`, `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`)\n\nWhat should I do with these issues?\n\n1) Fix them automatically  \n2) Create action items in the story  \n3) Show me details on a specific issue"}]}}

(`src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx`#L4, `src/pages/auth/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx`#L2, `src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`#L3, `src/router/index.tsx`#L11) - FIXED: All imports now use feature index exports\n109-- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] AC6 says redirect to `/judge`, but code redirects to `/judge/dashboard`. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`#L42, `src/router/AdminRoute.tsx`#L48) - FIXED: AdminRoute now redirects to /judge\n110-- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Uncommitted `.codex` changes not documented in File List. (`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2-1-super-admin-login.md`#L432) - RESOLVED: .codex files are not part of implementation artifacts\n111-- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] React namespace usage violates project rules in tests. (`src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.test.tsx`#L12) - FIXED: Changed React.ReactNode to import type { ReactNode }\n112-- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] AC2 requires exact error text; error message includes a trailing period.

Files created/modified but not `git add`ed. (All 24 files listed in \"File List\")\n114-- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] AC6: Judge Role Redirect (AC6) points to `/judge` instead of `/judge/dashboard`. (`src/router/AdminRoute.tsx`, Line 48)\n115-- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Architectural Flaw: Redundant `isLoading` State. `LoginForm.tsx` has local `isLoading` instead of using `useAuth`'s. (`src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.tsx`, Line 28)\n116-- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Architectural Flaw: Inconsistent API Exports in `authApi.ts`. Exports individual functions AND a bundled object. (`src/features/auth/api/authApi.ts`, Lines 28-135)\n117-- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Missing Requirement: Manual Tests Not Performed. Task 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 are unchecked.

(`src/features/admin/components/AdminLayout.tsx`#L1) - RESOLVED: Story 2.2 (Admin Layout) was implemented during Story 2.1 code review iterations. All Story 2.2 work is completed, tested (9 tests pass), committed in this branch, and documented in 2-2-admin-layout-dashboard-shell.md. RLS migration (is_admin function) was necessary fix for AC5-AC7 to work correctly. \n124-- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] React namespace usage in UI primitives violates project rules. (`src/components/ui/avatar.tsx`#L1) - RESOLVED: Added exception to project-context.md for shadcn/ui components. These are auto-generated by shadcn CLI and use their canonical React namespace style (9 files). Project rule applies to features/, pages/, contexts/, router/, lib/ only.\n125-- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Missing tests for auth state and route protection (AC5–AC7). (`src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`#L1) - RESOLVED: Created comprehensive test files (AuthProvider.test.tsx - 10 tests, AdminRoute.test.tsx - 5 tests, ProtectedRoute.test.tsx - 5 tests). All 56 project tests pass. Tests cover: initial state, signIn/signOut, session subscription, loading states, unauthenticated redirects (AC5), judge role redirects (AC6), admin access.\n126-- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] `ForgotPasswordPage` rethrows errors; no catch in form leads to unhandled rejection noise. (`src/pages/auth/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx`#L11) - RESOLVED: Added catch block in ForgotPasswordForm.tsx to handle rethrown errors gracefully. Form now properly prevents success state on error without unhandled rejection noise.\n127-- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] React namespace type usage remains in router tests (violates project rule). Possible fix: replace `React.ReactNode` with `type ReactNode` import from `react` and use `children: ReactNode` in both files. (`src/router/AdminRoute.test.tsx`#L33, `src/router/ProtectedRoute.test.tsx`#L33) - FIXED: Added `import { type ReactNode } from 'react'` and changed `children: React.ReactNode` to `children: ReactNode` in both test files\n128-- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] AC6 says redirect to `/judge`, but `/judge` immediately redirects to `/judge/dashboard`, so effective destination does not match AC text. Decide desired target and align AC or routing.
