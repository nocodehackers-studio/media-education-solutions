This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Contact administrator\" text (no self-signup for admins)\n\n**ForgotPasswordForm.tsx:**\n- Email field only\n- Success message: \"Check your email for reset instructions\"\n- Link back to login\n\n**ResetPasswordPage.tsx:**\n- Handles Supabase password reset callback\n- New password + confirm password fields\n- Success redirects to login with toast\n\n### Protected Route Pattern\n\n```typescript\n// AdminRoute.tsx\nexport function AdminRoute({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const { user, isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();\n  const location = useLocation();\n\n  if (isLoading) {\n    return <LoadingScreen />;\n  }\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return <Navigate to=\"/login\" state={{ from: location }} replace />;\n  }\n\n  if (user?.role !== 'admin') {\n    // Judge trying to access admin routes\n    return <Navigate to=\"/judge\" replace />;\n  }\n\n  return <>{children}</>;\n}\n```\n\n### Route Configuration\n\n```typescript\n// router/index.tsx\nconst router = createBrowserRouter([\n  // Public routes\n  { path: '/login', element: <LoginPage /> },\n  { path: '/forgot-password', element: <ForgotPasswordPage /> },\n  { path: '/reset-password', element: <ResetPasswordPage /> },\n\n  // Admin routes (protected)\n  {\n    path: '/admin',\n    element: <AdminRoute><AdminLayout /></AdminRoute>,\n    children: [\n      { index: true, element: <Navigate to=\"/admin/dashboard\" replace /> },\n      { path: 'dashboard', element: <DashboardPage /> },\n      // More admin routes added in Story 2.2+\n    ],\n  },\n\n  // Judge routes (protected) - placeholder for Epic 3\n  {\n    path: '/judge',\n    element: <JudgeRoute><JudgeLayout /></JudgeRoute>,\n    children: [\n      { index: true, element: <Navigate to=\"/judge/dashboard\" replace /> },\n      { path: 'dashboard', element: <JudgeDashboardPlaceholder /> },\n    ],\n  },\n\n  // Default redirect\n  { path: '/', element: <Navigate to=\"/login\" replace /> },\n  { path: '*', element: <NotFoundPage /> },\n]);\n```\n\n### Styling Notes\n\n- Use shadcn/ui Card for login form container\n- Match Untitled UI neutral color scheme (already configured)\n- Responsive: mobile-first, max-width on form\n- Skeleton loading state while checking auth\n\n### Error Handling\n\nUse standardized error codes from `lib/errorCodes.ts`:\n```typescript\n// Add these error codes if not present\nexport const ERROR_CODES = {\n  // ... existing codes\n  AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS: 'AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS',\n  AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED: 'AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED',\n  AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED: 'AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED',\n} as const;\n```\n\n### Testing Notes\n\n**Unit Tests (LoginForm.test.tsx):**\n- Renders email and password fields\n- Shows validation errors for empty fields\n- Shows validation errors for invalid email format\n- Calls onSubmit with valid data\n- Disables submit button while loading\n\n**Manual Testing Checklist:**\n1. Create admin user in Supabase Dashboard\n2. Update role to 'admin' in profiles table\n3. Test login with correct credentials → redirects to /admin/dashboard\n4. Test login with wrong password → shows error toast\n5. Test login with non-existent email → shows error toast\n6. Test /admin/* access when logged out → redirects to /login\n7. Test password reset email is sent\n8. Test logout clears session and redirects\n\n### Previous Story Learnings Applied\n\nFrom Epic 1:\n- All imports from feature index, never deep paths\n- Named exports only, no default exports\n- Toast for user feedback: `toast.error()`, `toast.success()`\n- React Hook Form + Zod for all forms\n- TanStack Query for server state (not needed here - auth uses Supabase client directly)\n- Update index.ts immediately after creating new files\n- Update PROJECT_INDEX.md with new components\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n1. **Password hashing**: Handled by Supabase Auth (bcrypt)\n2. **Session tokens**: Stored in localStorage by Supabase (JWT)\n3. **Role enforcement**: RLS policies + frontend route guards\n4. **No role in JWT claims**: Always fetch from profiles table (prevents token manipulation)\n5. **HTTPS only**: Enforced by Vercel deployment\n\n### References\n\n- [Source: architecture/core-architectural-decisions.md#Authentication & Security]\n- [Source: prd/functional-requirements.md#FR1, FR4]\n- [Source: epic-2-super-admin-authentication-contest-management.md#Story 2.1]\n- [Source: ux-design/user-journey-flows.md#Flow 3: Admin Contest Creation]\n- [Source: project-context.md#Authentication Rules]\n- [Supabase Auth Docs: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth]\n- [React Router Protected Routes: https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial#authenticated-routes]\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\nN/A\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- Implemented full auth context with Supabase integration (AuthContext, AuthProvider, useAuth hook)\n- Created LoginForm with React Hook Form + Zod validation (mode: 'onBlur' for inline validation)\n- Created ForgotPasswordForm and ResetPasswordPage for password recovery flow\n- Created ProtectedRoute, AdminRoute, JudgeRoute for role-based access control\n- AdminRoute redirects judges to /judge/dashboard, unauthenticated users to /login\n- Created placeholder admin and judge dashboard pages\n- Added auth error codes (AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS, AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED, AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED)\n- All unit tests pass (10 tests in LoginForm.test.tsx)\n- Build, lint, and type-check all pass\n- **CRITICAL FIX: RLS Policy Infinite Recursion** - Fixed \"Admins can read all profiles\" policy by creating `is_admin()` SECURITY DEFINER function to prevent recursive policy checks (Supabase migration required)\n- **ALL MANUAL TESTS PASS** (2026-01-12):\n  - ✓ 8.2: Login with valid admin credentials → redirects to /admin/dashboard\n  - ✓ 8.3: Invalid credentials show error toast\n  - ✓ 8.4: Password reset flow sends email successfully\n  - ✓ 8.5: Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to /login\n- **CODE REVIEW FIXES APPLIED** (2026-01-12):\n  - ✓ Fixed LoginForm.test.tsx to wrap tests in AuthContext.Provider mock\n  - ✓ Fixed React namespace usage (React.ReactNode → import type { ReactNode })\n  - ✓ Fixed deep imports across 4 files (LoginPage, ForgotPasswordPage, AuthProvider, router/index)\n  - ✓ Fixed AC6 redirect from /judge/dashboard to /judge in AdminRoute.tsx\n  - ✓ Fixed AC2 error text - removed trailing period from \"Invalid email or password\"\n\n### Change Log\n\n| Date | Change | Files |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| 2026-01-12 | Implemented Story 2.1 Super Admin Login | See File List below |\n\n### File List\n\n**New Files:**\n- src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx\n- src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx\n- src/features/auth/api/authApi.ts\n- src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.tsx\n- src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.test.tsx\n- src/features/auth/components/ForgotPasswordForm.tsx\n- src/features/auth/types/auth.types.ts\n- src/features/auth/types/auth.schemas.ts\n- src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx\n- src/pages/auth/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx\n- src/pages/auth/ResetPasswordPage.tsx\n- src/pages/admin/DashboardPage.tsx\n- src/pages/judge/DashboardPage.tsx\n- src/router/ProtectedRoute.tsx\n- src/router/AdminRoute.tsx\n- src/router/JudgeRoute.tsx\n\n**Modified Files:**\n- PROJECT_INDEX.md\n- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml\n- src/contexts/index.ts\n- src/features/auth/index.ts\n- src/lib/errorCodes.ts\n- src/main.tsx\n- src/pages/index.ts\n- src/router/index.tsx\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

       -- admin/judge\n  first_name TEXT,\n  last_name TEXT,\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()\n)\n```\n\n**Ranking Array Structure:**\n```json\n[\n  { \"submission_id\": \"uuid\", \"tier\": \"master_creator\" },\n  { \"submission_id\": \"uuid\", \"tier\": \"master_creator\" },\n  { \"submission_id\": \"uuid\", \"tier\": \"advanced_producer\" }\n]\n```\n- Index = Rank (0 = 1st place, 1 = 2nd place, etc.)\n- Top 3 indices = Winners displayed on winners page\n- Constraint: Lower-tier submissions cannot rank above higher-tier submissions\n\n**Rating Tiers:**\n\n| Tier | Rating Range |\n|------|--------------|\n| Developing Skills | 1-2 |\n| Emerging Producer | 3-4 |\n| Proficient Creator | 5-6 |\n| Advanced Producer | 7-8 |\n| Master Creator | 9-10 |\n\n## Authentication & Security\n\n**Auth Flows by Role:**\n\n| Role | Method | Implementation |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| Super Admin | Email + Password | Supabase Auth standard login |\n| Judge | Email + Password | Supabase invite → set password on first visit |\n| Participant | Contest Code + Participant Code | Stateless, localStorage, no Supabase account |\n\n**Participant Session Security:**\n- Codes stored in localStorage with `last_activity` timestamp\n- Session expires after **120 minutes** of inactivity\n- Active upload keeps session alive\n- Logout button with reminder for shared devices\n\n**Bunny Upload Security (CRITICAL):**\n- No direct public Bunny endpoints\n- Signed upload URLs generated server-side via Edge Function\n- Validation before URL generation: valid codes, category open, within limits\n- Storage isolation: `/{contest_id}/{category_id}/{participant_code}/{file}`\n- Rate limiting per participant per contest\n\n## API Patterns\n\n| Operation | Approach | Reason |\n|-----------|----------|--------|\n| Read/write contests, categories, submissions | Supabase Client + RLS | Simple CRUD, RLS enforces access |\n| Generate Bunny signed URLs | Edge Function | Secret keys, validation logic |\n| Send email notifications | Edge Function | Brevo API keys, async |\n| Validate participant codes | Edge Function | Rate limiting, session token |\n\n**Row Level Security (RLS):**\n- Admin: Full access to all tables\n- Judge: Read assigned categories + submissions, write reviews/rankings\n- Participant (via Edge Function): Own submissions only\n\n## Frontend Architecture\n\n**State Management:**\n\n| State Type | Solution |\n|------------|----------|\n| Server state | TanStack Query |\n| UI state | React Context |\n| Form state | React Hook Form + Zod |\n\n**Folder Structure: Bulletproof React**\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── features/\n│   ├── auth/\n│   │   ├── api/\n│   │   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── types/\n│   │   └── index.ts          # REQUIRED\n│   ├── contests/\n│   │   └── index.ts          # REQUIRED\n│   ├── categories/\n│   │   └── index.ts          # REQUIRED\n│   ├── submissions/\n│   │   └── index.ts          #

components/ui/            # shadcn/ui primitives only\n├── lib/                      # Supabase client, global utilities\n├── pages/                    # Thin route wrappers\n└── types/                    # Shared types only\n```\n\n**Coding Guideline: Feature Index Files**\n\nEvery feature folder MUST have an `index.ts` that exports its public API.\n\n```typescript\n// features/reviews/index.ts\nexport { RatingScale } from './components/RatingScale';\nexport { useReviews, useSubmitReview } from './hooks/useReviews';\nexport { reviewsApi } from './api/reviewsApi';\nexport type { Review, Rating, Tier } from './types/review.types';\n```\n\n**Import Rule:**\n```typescript\n// ✅ Good\nimport { RatingScale, useReviews } from '@/features/reviews';\n\n// ❌ Bad\nimport { RatingScale } from '@/features/reviews/components/RatingScale';\n```\n\n**For AI Agents:** When exploring or modifying a feature:\n1. FIRST read `features/{feature}/index.ts`\n2. Understand available exports before diving into subfolders\n3. When adding new exports, UPDATE the index.ts\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n**Environments:**\n\n| Environment | Supabase Project | Purpose |\n|-------------|------------------|---------|\n| development | Separate project | Local dev, safe to reset |\n| preview | Production project | PR preview deployments |\n| production | Production project | Live site |\n\n**Environment Variables:**\n\n| Service | Variables |\n|---------|-----------|\n| Supabase | `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` |\n| Bunny Storage | `BUNNY_STORAGE_API_KEY`, `BUNNY_STORAGE_ZONE` |\n| Bunny Stream | `BUNNY_STREAM_API_KEY`, `BUNNY_STREAM_LIBRARY_ID` |\n| Brevo | `BREVO_API_KEY` |\n| Sentry | `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` |\n\n**CI/CD Pipeline:**\n\n| Trigger | Action |\n|---------|--------|\n| Push to `main` | Deploy to production (Vercel) |\n| Push to PR branch | Deploy preview (Vercel) |\n| PR opened | Run lint, type-check, tests (GitHub Actions) |\n\n**Monitoring:**\n\n| Need | Solution |\n|------|----------|\n| Error tracking | Sentry (free tier) |\n| Analytics | Vercel Analytics |\n| Logs | Vercel + Supabase dashboards |\n\n## Updated Initialization Sequence\n\n```bash\n# 1. Create Vite project\nnpm create vite@latest media-education-solutions -- --template react-ts\ncd media-education-solutions\n\n# 2. Install Tailwind\nnpm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite\n\n# 3. Install shadcn/ui\nnpx shadcn@latest init\n\n# 4. Add Supabase\nnpm install @supabase/supabase-js\n\n# 5. Add form handling + data fetching\nnpm install react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers zod @tanstack/react-query\n\n# 6. Add routing\nnpm install react-router-dom\n\n# 7.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The platform serves three distinct user types — each should feel like it was purpose-built for them. Built with a modern, sleek aesthetic inspired by Linear, shadcn/ui, Untitled UI, and Stripe.\n\n## Target Users\n\n| User | Tech Comfort | Primary Emotion | UX Priority |\n|------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| **Jeb (Super Admin)** | High | \"I need control without overwhelm\" | Dashboard clarity, batch operations, zero guesswork |\n| **Judges** | Low | \"Just tell me what to do\" | Pristine simplicity, obvious progress, one-thing-at-a-time |\n| **Participants** | High | \"Will this work? Please work.\" | Upload confidence, deadline assurance, clear confirmation |\n| **T/L/C** | Irrelevant | \"Don't make me log in\" | Email-only interaction |\n\n## Key Design Challenges\n\n1. **The Judge Paradox** — Domain experts who are NOT tech-savvy. Interface must feel so obvious that reluctant judges think \"that was... actually fine\" after their first session. Zero learning curve.\n\n2. **Deadline Crunch Anxiety** — Participants uploading large videos minutes before deadline need absolute confidence. Progress indicators must be butter-smooth, confirmation unmistakable.\n\n3. **Anonymous-to-Revealed Transition** — Judges see only codes during review, but Admin sees everything. Admin view must surface participant data without breaking the mental model of anonymous judging.\n\n4. **Multi-Role, Single Platform** — Three distinct experiences sharing one codebase. Each role should feel purpose-built, not compromised.\n\n## Design Opportunities\n\n1. **Visual Sophistication** — Linear-inspired visual language: subtle gradients, refined typography, generous whitespace, premium \"this feels expensive\" quality across all screens.\n\n2. **Progress-as-Delight** — Judge progress bars that feel satisfying to fill. Subtle dopamine hit at completion with clean completion states.\n\n3. **Upload Confidence Theater** — Make upload experience feel expensive. Smooth progress, processing states, preview before submit, unmistakable confirmation.\n\n4. **Contextual Density** — Admin dashboard can be data-rich; Judge view should be zen-minimal. Same design system, different information density per role.\n"}}

What's next? Am I done?\n3. **Desktop-First, Responsive Always** — Optimize for laptop workflows, never break on mobile\n4. **Reliability is UX** — Technical performance IS the user experience\n5. **Role-Appropriate Density** — Same design system, right information density per context\n"}}

[Try again]\" (resumable upload if Bunny supports it — verify during implementation)\n- File rejected: Specific reason + what to do (\"File is 520MB. Maximum is 500MB. [Choose different file]\")\n- Server error: \"Something went wrong on our end. [Try again] — your file is safe locally\"\n\n## Pattern Classification\n\n**Established patterns we're using:**\n- Drag-and-drop upload (Dropbox, Google Drive)\n- Progress bar with real metrics (WeTransfer)\n- Preview before submit (YouTube)\n- Confirmation with timestamp (form submissions)\n\n**Our refinements:**\n- Timestamp locks at upload START (deadline fairness)\n- Grace period with visible countdown\n- \"Deadline-aware\" messaging throughout\n- Screenshot-worthy confirmation (Sofia texts her coach)\n\n**Implementation Notes:**\n- Resumable uploads: Verify if Bunny supports this; if not, design graceful retry\n- Grace period duration: Recommend 10-15 minutes, confirm with Jeb\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Read this FIRST before any implementation work._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n| Category | Technology | Version |\n|----------|------------|---------|\n| Framework | React | 19 |\n| Build | Vite | 6+ |\n| Language | TypeScript | Strict mode |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS | v4 |\n| Components | shadcn/ui | Latest |\n| Backend | Supabase | Auth + PostgreSQL + Edge Functions |\n| Server State | TanStack Query | Latest |\n| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod | Latest |\n| Routing | React Router DOM | v6+ |\n| Monitoring | Sentry | Latest |\n\n**External Services:**\n- Bunny Stream (video storage/streaming)\n- Bunny Storage (photos/assets)\n- Brevo (transactional email)\n\n---\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Feature Architecture (MOST IMPORTANT)\n\n**Mandatory Index Files:**\n```typescript\n// Every feature folder MUST have index.ts exporting ALL contents\n// features/submissions/index.ts\n\n// === Components ===\nexport { UploadProgress } from './components/UploadProgress';\nexport { SubmissionCard } from './components/SubmissionCard';\n\n// === Hooks ===\nexport { useSubmissions } from './hooks/useSubmissions';\n\n// === API ===\nexport { submissionsApi } from './api/submissionsApi';\n\n// === Types ===\nexport type { Submission, SubmissionStatus } from './types/submission.types';\n```\n\n**Import Rules:**\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Always import from feature index\nimport { UploadProgress, useSubmissions } from '@/features/submissions';\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Never import from deep paths\nimport { UploadProgress } from '@/features/submissions/components/UploadProgress';\n```\n\n**After Creating Any New File:**\n1. Add export to the feature's `index.ts` immediately\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding new features or major components\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\n| Context | Convention | Example |\n|---------|------------|---------|\n| Database tables | snake_case, plural | `participants`, `contest_codes` |\n| Database columns | snake_case | `created_at`, `contest_id` |\n| TypeScript files | PascalCase (components), camelCase (utils) | `RatingScale.tsx`, `submissionsApi.ts` |\n| Functions/variables | camelCase | `getContests`, `isLoading` |\n| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE | `MAX_FILE_SIZE` |\n| Types/Interfaces | PascalCase | `Contest`, `SubmissionStatus` |\n| Hooks | use + PascalCase | `useContests`, `useFileUpload` |\n\n**Data Transformation:**\n- Database returns `snake_case` → Transform to `camelCase` in API layer\n- Never mix conventions within same layer\n\n### State Management Rules\n\n| State Type | Solution | Location |\n|------------|----------|----------|\n| Server data | TanStack Query | Feature hooks |\n| Form data | React Hook Form | Component-local |\n| Auth state | React Context | `AuthContext` |\n| Participant session | React Context | `ParticipantSessionContext` |\n| Local UI | useState | Component-local |\n\n**Never:**\n- Use useState for server data (use TanStack Query)\n- Create global state for form data\n- Mix state management solutions for same concern\n\n### Authentication Rules\n\n**Three Separate Auth Flows:**\n\n| Role | Method | Implementation |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| Admin | Email + Password | Supabase Auth |\n| Judge | Email + Password | Supabase Auth (invite flow) |\n| Participant | Contest Code + Participant Code | localStorage (NO Supabase account) |\n\n**Participant Session:**\n- Store codes in localStorage with `last_activity` timestamp\n- Expire after **120 minutes** of inactivity\n- Active upload keeps session alive\n- Clear on logout (shared device reminder)\n\n### Supabase Security Rules (MANDATORY)\n\n**Signup Triggers:**\n- ALWAYS force default role ('judge') in signup triggers\n- NEVER trust user metadata for role assignment (prevents privilege escalation)\n- ALWAYS use `SET search_path = public` in SECURITY DEFINER functions\n\n```sql\n-- CORRECT: Force role, ignore metadata\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()\nRETURNS TRIGGER\nSET search_path = public  -- Prevents search_path hijacking\nAS $$\nBEGIN\n  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email, role)\n  VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.email, 'judge');  -- Always 'judge', never from metadata\n  RETURN NEW;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;\n```\n\n**RLS Policies:**\n- ALWAYS enable RLS on tables with user data\n- NEVER allow users to modify their own role or email via RLS UPDATE policies\n- Use trigger-based column protection for sensitive fields\n\n**Column Protection Pattern:**\n```sql\n-- Trigger to prevent role/email modification\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION protect_sensitive_columns()\nRETURNS TRIGGER AS $$\nBEGIN\n  IF OLD.role IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.role THEN\n    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Cannot modify role column';\n  END IF;\n  IF OLD.email IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.email THEN\n    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Cannot modify email column';\n  END IF;\n  RETURN NEW;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\nCREATE TRIGGER protect_profile_columns\n  BEFORE UPDATE ON profiles\n  FOR EACH ROW\n  EXECUTE FUNCTION protect_sensitive_columns();\n```\n\n**TypeScript Types Must Match:**\n```typescript\n// Exclude protected columns from Update type\nUpdate: {\n  first_name?: string | null;\n  last_name?: string | null;\n  // NO role, NO email, NO id\n};\n```\n\n### Bunny Upload Security (CRITICAL)\n\n**Never expose Bunny credentials to client.**\n\n**Upload Flow:**\n1. Client requests signed URL from Edge Function\n2. Edge Function validates: participant codes, category open, within limits\n3. Edge Function returns short-lived signed URL\n4. Client uploads directly to Bunny using signed URL\n\n**Storage Path Pattern:**\n```\n/{contest_id}/{category_id}/{participant_code}/{filename}\n```\n\n### Anonymous Judging Rules\n\n**Judge queries must NEVER access participant PII.**\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Judge view query\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('id, media_url, participant_id')  // participant_id is UUID, not PII\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Joins to participant data\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('*, participants(name, organization)')  // EXPOSES PII\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\n**Use Standardized Error Codes:**\n```typescript\nimport { ERROR_CODES } from '@/lib/errorCodes';\n\n// Always use predefined codes\nthrow new AppError(ERROR_CODES.CATEGORY_CLOSED, 'Category deadline has passed');\n```\n\n**Error Codes Available:**\n- `INVALID_CODES`, `SESSION_EXPIRED`, `CONTEST_NOT_FOUND`\n- `CATEGORY_CLOSED`, `SUBMISSION_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`\n- `FILE_TOO_LARGE`, `INVALID_FILE_TYPE`\n- `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `SERVER_ERROR`\n\n### React Import Standards\n\n**Always use explicit imports, never React namespace:**\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Explicit type imports\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { type ComponentProps, type HTMLAttributes } from 'react';\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Don't use React namespace\nimport React from 'react';\nconst props: React.ComponentProps<typeof Button>;  // Don't do this\n```\n\n**Type-only imports for types:**\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Use 'type' keyword for type-only imports\nimport { type ReactNode, type FC } from 'react';\n\n// Also acceptable\nimport type { ReactNode, FC } from 'react';\n```\n\n### Component Structure\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Imports (React first, then external, then internal)\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { type ComponentProps } from 'react';\nimport { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui';\nimport { useContests } from '@/features/contests';\n\n// 2. Types (interface for props)\ninterface ContestCardProps {\n  contest: Contest;\n  onSelect: (id: string) => void;\n}\n\n// 3. Component (named export, not default)\nexport function ContestCard({ contest, onSelect }: ContestCardProps) {\n  // hooks first\n  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);\n\n  // handlers\n  const handleClick = () => onSelect(contest.id);\n\n  // render\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n**Co-locate tests with source:**\n```\nfeatures/submissions/components/\n├── UploadProgress.tsx\n├── UploadProgress.test.tsx  ← Same folder\n```\n\n**Test Naming:**\n- Unit tests: `{ComponentName}.test.tsx`\n- Integration tests: `{feature}.integration.test.ts`\n\n### Zod Schema Rules\n\n**Single Source of Truth:**\n```typescript\n// Define schema in types/ folder\n// features/contests/types/contest.schemas.ts\nexport const contestFormSchema = z.object({\n  name: z.string().min(1, 'Required'),\n  contestCode: z.string().length(6, 'Must be 6 digits'),\n});\n\n// Use in form AND API validation\n```\n\n### Git Workflow Rules (MANDATORY - ENFORCED BY WORKFLOWS)\n\n**🔥 CRITICAL: Branch discipline is now ENFORCED by dev-story and code-review workflows 🔥**\n\n**Branch-Per-Story (Parallel Development):**\n\nEach story MUST have its own dedicated branch. Multiple stories can be in progress simultaneously on separate branches.\n\n**Branch Naming Convention (EXACT MATCH REQUIRED):**\n```bash\nstory/{story-key}\n\n# The branch name MUST exactly match the story filename (without .md extension)\n# Examples:\nstory/1-4-core-ui-components  # for file: 1-4-core-ui-components.md\nstory/1-5-ci-cd-config        # for file: 1-5-ci-cd-config.md\nstory/2-1-super-admin-login   # for file: 2-1-super-admin-login.md\n```\n\n**Automatic Enforcement:**\n\n**When dev-story workflow runs:**\n1. **Checks if branch `story/{story-key}` exists**\n2. **If exists:** Checks out the branch and continues\n3. **If not exists:** Creates branch from main, checks out, and continues\n4. **Validates:** Confirms you're on correct branch before any code changes\n5. **Before marking \"review\":** Ensures all changes committed and branch pushed to remote\n\n**When code-review workflow runs:**\n1. **REQUIRES branch `story/{story-key}` to exist** - HALTS if missing\n2. **Checks out the story branch** to review actual changes\n3. **After approval (status=done):** Offers to merge branch automatically or create PR\n4. **Commits any review fixes** made during review to the story branch\n\n**Starting a New Story:**\n```bash\n# Dev workflow handles this automatically - no manual branch creation needed!\n# Just run: /dev-story\n\n# Workflow will:\n# - Detect no branch exists for story\n# - Create story/{story-key} from main\n# - Checkout the branch\n# - Begin implementation\n```\n\n**Switching Between Stories:**\n```bash\n# Commit current work before switching\ngit add -A && git commit -m \"{story-id}: WIP - {brief description}\"\ngit checkout story/{other-story-id}\n\n# Or let dev-story handle it - it will checkout correct branch automatically\n```\n\n**Commit Message Format (Auto-Generated by Dev):**\n\nThe Dev agent MUST auto-generate descriptive commit messages following this format:\n\n```\n{story-id}: {action} {what changed}\n\nActions: Add, Update, Fix, Refactor, Remove, Configure, Implement\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n- `1-4: Add Button and Card components`\n- `1-4: Update index.ts with new exports`\n- `1-4: Fix TypeScript errors in form validation`\n- `1-5: Configure Vite environment variables`\n- `2-1: Implement login form with Supabase auth`\n\n**Before Marking Story as \"review\" Status:**\n\n1. Switch to the story's branch\n2. ALL changes for that story must be committed\n3. Branch must be pushed to remote\n4. Working tree must be clean (`git status` shows nothing to commit)\n\n**Pre-Review Checklist (MANDATORY):**\n\nBefore marking any story as \"review\" status, verify ALL items:\n\n```bash\n# Git Status (REQUIRED)\n□ git status          # Must show: \"nothing to commit, working tree clean\"\n□ git log --oneline -5  # Verify commits have story ID prefix\n□ git push -u origin story/{story-id}-{description}  # Push to remote\n\n# Quality Gates (REQUIRED)\n□ npm run build       # Must pass with no errors\n□ npm run lint        # Must pass with no errors\n□ npm run type-check  # Must pass with no errors\n□ npm run test        # Must pass (if tests exist for story)\n\n# Import Compliance (REQUIRED)\n□ grep -r \"from '@/\" src/ | grep -v \"/index'\" | grep -v \"from '@/lib'\" | grep -v \"from '@/components/ui'\"\n  # Should return empty - no deep imports allowed\n\n# Documentation (REQUIRED)\n□ All Acceptance Criteria verified with evidence (test output, screenshots, logs)\n□ File List in story generated from git (see File List Generation below)\n□ Dev Notes updated with any new patterns discovered\n```\n\n**File List Generation (MANDATORY):**\n\nNEVER manually write the File List. Always generate from git:\n\n```bash\n# Run these commands and copy output to story File List section:\n\necho \"**New Files:**\"\ngit status --porcelain | grep \"^??\" | cut -c4- | sed 's/^/- /'\n\necho \"**Modified Files:**\"\ngit status --porcelain | grep \"^ M\\|^M \" | cut -c4- | sed 's/^/- /'\n\necho \"**Deleted Files:**\"\ngit status --porcelain | grep \"^ D\\|^D \" | cut -c4- | sed 's/^/- /'\n```\n\n**Code Review Will Be REJECTED If:**\n- ❌ Story changes are not on a dedicated story branch → **NOW ENFORCED:** code-review HALTS if branch doesn't exist\n- ❌ Uncommitted changes exist on the story branch → **NOW ENFORCED:** dev-story validates before marking \"review\"\n- ❌ Branch is not pushed to remote → **NOW ENFORCED:** dev-story auto-pushes before marking \"review\"\n- ❌ Commit messages don't follow the `{story-id}: {action} {what}` format → Reviewers will flag this\n\n**Branch Enforcement Summary:**\n- ✅ **dev-story workflow:** Automatically creates/checks out correct branch, validates before marking \"review\"\n- ✅ **code-review workflow:** Validates branch exists before review, offers auto-merge after approval\n- ✅ **Parallel development:** Multiple stories can safely run simultaneously on separate branches\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)\n\n1. **Never import from deep paths** — Always use feature index\n2. **Never use useState for server data** — Use TanStack Query\n3. **Never expose Bunny credentials to client** — Use Edge Functions\n4. **Never join participant PII in judge queries** — Anonymous judging\n5. **Never skip index.ts updates** — Every export must be indexed\n6. **Never mix naming conventions** — snake_case DB, camelCase code\n7. **Never store participant passwords** — Code-only access\n8. **Never use default exports** — Named exports only\n9. **Never trust user metadata for role assignment** — Force default role in triggers\n10. **Never manually write File Lists** — Generate from git status\n11. **Never use React namespace (React.ComponentProps)** — Use explicit imports\n12. **Never skip pre-review checklist** — All gates must pass before review\n13. **Never work on wrong branch** — Workflows enforce story/{story-key} branching (auto-created if missing)\n14. **Never mark story \"review\" with uncommitted changes** — Workflow validates and auto-pushes\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n**Before implementing any feature:**\n1. Read `PROJECT_INDEX.md` at project root\n2. Read the feature's `index.ts` to understand existing exports\n3. Check this file (project-context.md) for patterns and rules\n\n**After implementing:**\n1. Update feature's `index.ts` with new exports\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding major components\n3. Run full pre-review checklist before marking \"review\"\n\n**Story File Pattern:**\n- Do NOT duplicate \"Previous Story Learnings\" in story files\n- Reference: `See project-context.md for established patterns`\n- This file is the single source of truth for patterns and rules\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\n---\n\n_Last Updated: 2026-01-12 (Branch Enforcement Added)_\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
