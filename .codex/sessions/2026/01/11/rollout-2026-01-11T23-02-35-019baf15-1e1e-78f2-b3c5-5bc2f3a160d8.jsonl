Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

that **admin and judge authentication is ready to implement**.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### AC1: Supabase Client Configured\n**Given** Supabase client is configured\n**When** I import from `@/lib/supabase`\n**Then** I get a typed Supabase client connected to the project\n\n### AC2: Profiles Table Schema\n**Given** the database migration runs\n**When** I check the schema\n**Then** the `profiles` table exists with columns:\n- id (UUID, PRIMARY KEY, FK to auth.users)\n- email (TEXT NOT NULL)\n- role (TEXT NOT NULL) - values: 'admin', 'judge'\n- first_name (TEXT)\n- last_name (TEXT)\n- created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now())\n\n### AC3: Auth Trigger for Profile Creation\n**Given** a user signs up via Supabase Auth\n**When** the auth trigger fires\n**Then** a corresponding row is created in the profiles table\n\n### AC4: Row Level Security (RLS)\n**Given** RLS is enabled on profiles\n**When** an unauthenticated request tries to read profiles\n**Then** the request is denied\n\n### AC5: Environment Variables\n**Given** environment variables are set\n**When** the app loads\n**Then** VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are available to the client\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Task 1: Install Supabase Client (AC: 1)\n  - [x] 1.1 Run `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`\n  - [x] 1.2 Verify installation in package.json\n\n- [x] Task 2: Create Supabase Client Configuration (AC: 1, 5)\n  - [x] 2.1 Create `src/lib/supabase.ts` with typed client\n  - [x] 2.2 Create `src/types/supabase.ts` for database types (placeholder)\n  - [x] 2.3 Update `src/lib/index.ts` to export supabase client\n  - [x] 2.4 Update `.env.example` with Supabase variables\n  - [x] 2.5 Create `.env.local` with actual values (gitignored)\n\n- [x] Task 3: Initialize Supabase Project Structure (AC: 2)\n  - [x] 3.1 Run `npx supabase init` to create supabase/ folder\n  - [x] 3.2 Verify supabase/config.toml is created\n  - [x] 3.3 Create supabase/migrations/ directory structure\n\n- [x] Task 4: Create Profiles Table Migration (AC: 2)\n  - [x] 4.1 Create migration file: `supabase/migrations/00001_create_profiles.sql`\n  - [x] 4.2 Define profiles table with all columns per schema\n  - [x] 4.3 Add foreign key constraint to auth.users\n\n- [x] Task 5: Create Auth Trigger (AC: 3)\n  - [x] 5.1 Add trigger function to migration: `handle_new_user()`\n  - [x] 5.2 Add trigger: `on_auth_user_created`\n  - [x] 5.3 Set default role to 'judge' (admin created manually)\n\n- [x] Task 6: Configure Row Level Security (AC: 4)\n  - [x] 6.1 Enable RLS on profiles

with TypeScript strict mode\n- Path aliases: `@/*` → `./src/*` (configured in vite.config.ts and tsconfig.json)\n- shadcn/ui: new-york style, neutral base color\n- ESLint: modern flat config (`eslint.config.js`, not `.eslintrc.cjs`)\n- Placeholder exports use `export {}` pattern\n- PROJECT_INDEX.md exists at root for LLM discoverability\n\n**File Locations Established:**\n- `src/lib/index.ts` - exports utils (cn helper)\n- `src/lib/utils.ts` - cn() helper from shadcn\n- `src/types/index.ts` - shared types placeholder\n- `.env.example` - has placeholder for VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY\n\n### Supabase Client Setup\n\n**Create `src/lib/supabase.ts`:**\n```typescript\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';\nimport type { Database } from '@/types/supabase';\n\nconst supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;\nconst supabaseAnonKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;\n\nif (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseAnonKey) {\n  throw new Error('Missing Supabase environment variables');\n}\n\nexport const supabase = createClient<Database>(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);\n```\n\n**Create `src/types/supabase.ts` (placeholder):**\n```typescript\n// Database types will be generated via: npx supabase gen types typescript\n// For now, use a minimal placeholder\n\nexport type Database = {\n  public: {\n    Tables: {\n      profiles: {\n        Row: {\n          id: string;\n          email: string;\n          role: 'admin' | 'judge';\n          first_name: string | null;\n          last_name: string | null;\n          created_at: string;\n        };\n        Insert: {\n          id: string;\n          email: string;\n          role?: 'admin' | 'judge';\n          first_name?: string | null;\n          last_name?: string | null;\n          created_at?: string;\n        };\n        Update: {\n          email?: string;\n          role?: 'admin' | 'judge';\n          first_name?: string | null;\n          last_name?: string | null;\n        };\n      };\n    };\n  };\n};\n```\n\n**Update `src/lib/index.ts`:**\n```typescript\n// === Utilities ===\nexport { cn } from './utils';\n\n// === Supabase ===\nexport { supabase } from './supabase';\n```\n\n### Database Migration\n\n**Create `supabase/migrations/00001_create_profiles.sql`:**\n```sql\n-- Create profiles table (linked to auth.users)\nCREATE TABLE public.profiles (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  email TEXT NOT NULL,\n  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'judge')),\n  first_name TEXT,\n  last_name TEXT,\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() NOT NULL\n);\n\n-- Enable Row Level Security\nALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;\n\n-- Policy: Users can read their own profile\nCREATE POLICY \"Users can read own profile\"\n  ON public.profiles\n  FOR SELECT\n  USING (auth.uid() = id);\n\n-- Policy: Users can update their own profile (limited fields)\nCREATE POLICY \"Users can update own profile\"\n  ON public.profiles\n  FOR UPDATE\n  USING (auth.uid() = id)\n  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);\n\n-- Policy: Admins can read all profiles\nCREATE POLICY \"Admins can read all profiles\"\n  ON public.profiles\n  FOR SELECT\n  USING (\n    EXISTS (\n      SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles\n      WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'\n    )\n  );\n\n-- Function to handle new user signup\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()\nRETURNS TRIGGER AS $$\nBEGIN\n  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email, role)\n  VALUES (\n    NEW.id,\n    NEW.email,\n    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'role', 'judge')\n  );\n  RETURN NEW;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;\n\n-- Trigger to create profile on user signup\nCREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created\n  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users\n  FOR EACH ROW\n  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();\n\n-- Create index for common queries\nCREATE INDEX idx_profiles_role ON public.profiles(role);\nCREATE INDEX idx_profiles_email ON public.profiles(email);\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\n\n**Update `.env.example`:**\n```env\n# Supabase\nVITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co\nVITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key\n\n# Sentry (required in Story 1.5)\nVITE_SENTRY_DSN=\n\n# Server-side only (Edge Functions)\n# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key\n```\n\n**Create `.env.local` (gitignored, actual values):**\n```env\nVITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co\nVITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGc...\n```\n\n### Supabase CLI Commands\n\n```bash\n# Initialize Supabase in project (creates supabase/ folder)\nnpx supabase init\n\n# Link to remote project (get project ref from Supabase dashboard)\nnpx supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref\n\n# Push migrations to remote database\nnpx supabase db push\n\n# Generate TypeScript types from schema\nnpx supabase gen types typescript --linked > src/types/supabase.ts\n\n# Start local Supabase (for local development)\nnpx supabase start\n\n# Stop local Supabase\nnpx supabase stop\n```\n\n### RLS Testing\n\n**Test unauthenticated access (should fail):**\n```typescript\n// In browser console or test file\nimport { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';\n\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.from('profiles').select('*');\nconsole.log({ data, error }); // Should return empty data or error\n```\n\n**Test authenticated access:**\n```typescript\n// After signing in\nconst { data: user } = await supabase.auth.getUser();\nconst { data: profile } = await supabase\n  .from('profiles')\n  .select('*')\n  .eq('id', user.user?.id)\n  .single();\nconsole.log({ profile }); // Should return user's profile\n```\n\n### Project Structure After This Story\n\n```\nmedia-education-solutions/\n├── supabase/\n│   ├── config.toml\n│   └── migrations/\n│       └── 00001_create_profiles.sql\n├── src/\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   ├── index.ts          # Updated: exports supabase\n│   │   ├── utils.ts          # Existing:

SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to client**\n   - Only use in Edge Functions (server-side)\n   - VITE_* prefix = exposed to client\n   - No prefix = server-side only\n\n2. **Always use typed client**\n   - Import `Database` type for full TypeScript support\n   - Generate types after schema changes: `npx supabase gen types typescript`\n\n3. **RLS is mandatory**\n   - Never disable RLS on tables with user data\n   - Test policies before deploying\n\n4. **Profile creation is automatic**\n   - Auth trigger handles profile row creation\n   - Default role is 'judge' (admin must be set manually in DB)\n\n### Import Pattern\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Import from lib index\nimport { supabase } from '@/lib';\n\n// ✅ ALSO CORRECT - Direct import if needed\nimport { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Never import createClient directly in components\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';\n```\n\n### References\n\n- [Source:

Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n- Build successful with 0 errors\n- TypeScript compilation passed\n- ESLint passed (1 pre-existing warning in button.tsx unrelated to changes)\n- Migration `00001_create_profiles.sql` applied successfully to Supabase\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n1. **AC1 (Supabase Client Configured):** Created typed Supabase client at `src/lib/supabase.ts` with Database type inference. Exported via `src/lib/index.ts` for clean imports.\n\n2. **AC2 (Profiles Table Schema):** Migration creates profiles table with all specified columns: id (UUID PK with FK to auth.users), email, role (CHECK constraint for 'admin'|'judge'), first_name, last_name, created_at. Indexes added for role and email.\n\n3. **AC3 (Auth Trigger):** `handle_new_user()` function and `on_auth_user_created` trigger automatically create profile row on user signup with default role 'judge'.\n\n4. **AC4 (Row Level Security):** RLS enabled with 3 policies: users read own profile, users update own profile, admins read all profiles.\n\n5. **AC5 (Environment Variables):** `.env.example` updated with example URLs, `.env.local` created (gitignored) for actual credentials.\n\n6. **[Security Review Follow-ups Resolved]:**\n   - ✅ CRITICAL: Signup trigger now forces 'judge' role, ignoring user metadata (prevents privilege escalation)\n   - ✅ CRITICAL: Added `protect_profile_columns` trigger to prevent role/email/id changes; removed role/email from TypeScript Update type\n   - ✅ MEDIUM: Added `SET search_path = public` to SECURITY DEFINER function (prevents search_path hijacking)\n   - ✅ MEDIUM: File List verified accurate - _bmad changes are framework updates unrelated to story scope\n\n### Change Log\n\n| Date | Change | Files |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| 2026-01-11 | Installed @supabase/supabase-js@^2.90.1 | package.json |\n| 2026-01-11 | Created typed Supabase client | src/lib/supabase.ts |\n| 2026-01-11 | Created Database types placeholder | src/types/supabase.ts |\n| 2026-01-11 | Added supabase export to lib index | src/lib/index.ts |\n| 2026-01-11 | Added Database type export | src/types/index.ts |\n| 2026-01-11 | Initialized Supabase project structure | supabase/ |\n| 2026-01-11 | Created profiles migration with RLS | supabase/migrations/00001_create_profiles.sql |\n| 2026-01-11 | Updated env example with Supabase vars | .env.example |\n| 2026-01-11 | Created local env file | .env.local |\n| 2026-01-11 | Updated PROJECT_INDEX with supabase info | PROJECT_INDEX.md |\n| 2026-01-11 | [Security] Force 'judge' role in signup trigger, add search_path | supabase/migrations/00001_create_profiles.sql |\n| 2026-01-11 | [Security] Add protect_profile_columns trigger to prevent role/email updates | supabase/migrations/00001_create_profiles.sql |\n| 2026-01-11 | [Security] Remove role/email from Update type | src/types/supabase.ts |\n\n### File List\n\nFiles created/modified:\n- src/lib/supabase.ts (NEW)\n- src/types/supabase.ts (NEW, UPDATED - removed role/email from Update type for security)\n- src/lib/index.ts (UPDATED - added supabase export)\n- src/types/index.ts (UPDATED - added Database type export)\n- supabase/config.toml (GENERATED by supabase init)\n- supabase/migrations/00001_create_profiles.sql (NEW, UPDATED - security fixes: force 'judge' role, search_path, protect_profile_columns trigger)\n- .env.example (UPDATED - added Supabase vars with examples)\n- .env.local (NEW - gitignored, contains actual credentials)\n- PROJECT_INDEX.md (UPDATED - added supabase to lib section, added Database section)\n- package.json (UPDATED - added @supabase/supabase-js dependency)\n- package-lock.json (UPDATED - dependency lock)\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding new features or major components\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\n| Context | Convention | Example |\n|---------|------------|---------|\n| Database tables | snake_case, plural | `participants`, `contest_codes` |\n| Database columns | snake_case | `created_at`, `contest_id` |\n| TypeScript files | PascalCase (components), camelCase (utils) | `RatingScale.tsx`, `submissionsApi.ts` |\n| Functions/variables | camelCase | `getContests`, `isLoading` |\n| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE | `MAX_FILE_SIZE` |\n| Types/Interfaces | PascalCase | `Contest`, `SubmissionStatus` |\n| Hooks | use + PascalCase | `useContests`, `useFileUpload` |\n\n**Data Transformation:**\n- Database returns `snake_case` → Transform to `camelCase` in API layer\n- Never mix conventions within same layer\n\n### State Management Rules\n\n| State Type | Solution | Location |\n|------------|----------|----------|\n| Server data | TanStack Query | Feature hooks |\n| Form data | React Hook Form | Component-local |\n| Auth state | React Context | `AuthContext` |\n| Participant session | React Context | `ParticipantSessionContext` |\n| Local UI | useState | Component-local |\n\n**Never:**\n- Use useState for server data (use TanStack Query)\n- Create global state for form data\n- Mix state management solutions for same concern\n\n### Authentication Rules\n\n**Three Separate Auth Flows:**\n\n| Role | Method | Implementation |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| Admin | Email + Password | Supabase Auth |\n| Judge | Email + Password | Supabase Auth (invite flow) |\n| Participant | Contest Code + Participant Code | localStorage (NO Supabase account) |\n\n**Participant Session:**\n- Store codes in localStorage with `last_activity` timestamp\n- Expire after **120 minutes** of inactivity\n- Active upload keeps session alive\n- Clear on logout (shared device reminder)\n\n### Bunny Upload Security (CRITICAL)\n\n**Never expose Bunny credentials to client.**\n\n**Upload Flow:**\n1. Client requests signed URL from Edge Function\n2. Edge Function validates: participant codes, category open, within limits\n3. Edge Function returns short-lived signed URL\n4. Client uploads directly to Bunny using signed URL\n\n**Storage Path Pattern:**\n```\n/{contest_id}/{category_id}/{participant_code}/{filename}\n```\n\n### Anonymous Judging Rules\n\n**Judge queries must NEVER access participant PII.**\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Judge view query\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('id, media_url, participant_id')  // participant_id is UUID, not PII\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Joins to participant data\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('*, participants(name, organization)')  // EXPOSES PII\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\n**Use Standardized Error Codes:**\n```typescript\nimport { ERROR_CODES } from '@/lib/errorCodes';\n\n// Always use predefined codes\nthrow new AppError(ERROR_CODES.CATEGORY_CLOSED, 'Category deadline has passed');\n```\n\n**Error Codes Available:**\n- `INVALID_CODES`, `SESSION_EXPIRED`, `CONTEST_NOT_FOUND`\n- `CATEGORY_CLOSED`, `SUBMISSION_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`\n- `FILE_TOO_LARGE`, `INVALID_FILE_TYPE`\n- `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `SERVER_ERROR`\n\n### Component Structure\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Imports (React first, then external, then internal)\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui';\nimport { useContests } from '@/features/contests';\n\n// 2. Types (interface for props)\ninterface ContestCardProps {\n  contest: Contest;\n  onSelect: (id: string) => void;\n}\n\n// 3. Component (named export, not default)\nexport function ContestCard({ contest, onSelect }: ContestCardProps) {\n  // hooks first\n  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);\n\n  // handlers\n  const handleClick = () => onSelect(contest.id);\n\n  // render\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n**Co-locate tests with source:**\n```\nfeatures/submissions/components/\n├── UploadProgress.tsx\n├── UploadProgress.test.tsx  ← Same folder\n```\n\n**Test Naming:**\n- Unit tests: `{ComponentName}.test.tsx`\n- Integration tests: `{feature}.integration.test.ts`\n\n### Zod Schema Rules\n\n**Single Source of Truth:**\n```typescript\n// Define schema in types/ folder\n// features/contests/types/contest.schemas.ts\nexport const contestFormSchema = z.object({\n  name: z.string().min(1, 'Required'),\n  contestCode: z.string().length(6, 'Must be 6 digits'),\n});\n\n// Use in form AND API validation\n```\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)\n\n1. **Never import from deep paths** — Always use feature index\n2. **Never use useState for server data** — Use TanStack Query\n3. **Never expose Bunny credentials to client** — Use Edge Functions\n4. **Never join participant PII in judge queries** — Anonymous judging\n5. **Never skip index.ts updates** — Every export must be indexed\n6. **Never mix naming conventions** — snake_case DB, camelCase code\n7. **Never store participant passwords** — Code-only access\n8. **Never use default exports** — Named exports only\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n**Before implementing any feature:**\n1. Read `PROJECT_INDEX.md` at project root\n2. Read the feature's `index.ts` to understand existing exports\n3. Check architecture.md for patterns\n\n**After implementing:**\n1. Update feature's `index.ts` with new exports\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding major components\n3. Run type-check and lint before committing\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\n---\n\n_Last Updated: 2026-01-10_\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

participants | Participant codes, session, info | Placeholder |\n| submissions | File uploads, submission management | Placeholder |\n| reviews | Rating, feedback for submissions | Placeholder |\n| rankings | Drag-drop ranking, tier ordering | Placeholder |\n| notifications | Email triggers via Brevo | Placeholder |\n\n## Shared Code (src/lib/)\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| utils.ts | cn() helper, shared utilities |\n| supabase.ts | Typed Supabase client for auth + database |\n| queryClient.ts | TanStack Query client with default options |\n\n## Contexts (src/contexts/)\n\n| Context | Purpose | Status |\n|---------|---------|--------|\n| AuthContext | Admin/Judge authentication state | Planned (Epic 2) |\n| ParticipantSessionContext | Participant codes + 120min timeout | Planned (Epic 4) |\n\n## UI Components (src/components/ui/)\n\nshadcn/ui primitives: Button, Card, Input (more added as needed)\n\n## Pages (src/pages/)\n\n| Route Group |

Patterns\n\n### Import Rules\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Always import from feature index\nimport { Component } from '@/features/feature-name';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui';\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Never import from deep paths\nimport { Component } from '@/features/feature-name/components/Component';\n```\n\n### Named Exports Only\nAll components use named exports, never default exports.\n\n### File Naming\n- Components: PascalCase (`NotFoundPage.tsx`)\n- Utilities: camelCase (`utils.ts`)\n- Types: camelCase with `.types.ts` suffix\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n### Import Patterns\n```typescript\n// From lib (utilities, clients)\nimport { cn, supabase, queryClient } from '@/lib';\n\n// From features (components, hooks, types)\nimport { useAuth, LoginForm } from '@/features/auth';\n\n// From UI components\nimport { Button, Card, Input } from '@/components/ui';\n```\n\n### State Management\n| State Type | Solution | Location |\n|------------|----------|----------|\n| Server data | TanStack Query | Feature hooks |\n| Form data | React Hook Form | Component-local |\n| Auth state | React Context | `AuthContext` |\n| Participant session | React Context | `ParticipantSessionContext` |\n| Local UI | useState | Component-local |\n\n### package.json\n{\n  \"name\": \"media-education-solutions\",\n  \"private\":

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This duplication is a blocker for successful migration runs."}],"content":null,"encrypted_content":"gAAAAABpZC0k6hsj4rrD3wfprOkdKQieCOWRweiSA343rHFlLA9fOBDjysQqxrv9vDm6sSAwVFL5fmEem0NOfrshsaH-rZEPGoSdOof1K7Sxvm-Io3Fi6IrQGISv4PswTP_waJKriUcOQwrihFiYkvDfrsmEiWbqv8mHkwpciDc6_BeUlMVnfcWgXeC-w2WFgBZ7WU0M0MXlTnPMSpuHd09Mk-U0Jp5vctmp21i2HdGauf6kkxvB9-HGlONb9gBuAslHMWesuYC-LZ9eVqo2l4QsvaNK3vy5yqD525teAHx35N2FCx0uS0cbaocP-ZYqIC_vrHrx064WV2fZya6wgnVIUcNc1HAtMKH7CigBp2t2sqrD00oi3F0lkV5Ikx_EDHTlVyB2hLZJgPAO3UbWwlfaG3K0YdoeMJjAr0jBJsGrhR0mdMfYvKgBWkDVr4Sct4aMSZzYRscfLLOVYBN4fGwZWPTD4IrMsarc7D4_MgiU6K6znEtKkiiaMlJfMf6xxYzYlBL17dWeTFEi7Dwq_0acPnLIT2wn2J6nGSmSnckT9cWHqKELtMamUkNuNdW1ajxDRfpEbU5Ne0Pdz6eM85bVjoL59UQdwF4ejtxParSfz4Q0yW8cC6iqIX50x1kkcPxHmy30C5XDMeurtnU3Eh1mFJ0K8LbrHp0aedgNg5tsixTfNdMQWeHeYoryz7awN-eis1NePvZ-j9vExHcueG9sx1MTRYV7rCv14hkpa7hNb-skXOlqY-K0erwTIRfREsU5Q_sKIyN1CFL53oJIlLHJZjjxsLJ9ujJliIQTHR7hD_zuO5eDX88JmTeQp5cFsL5yA1T3TEJZmVuj47pn6EJfG8H7uUbj5mXL5FomZQi0NUDaOzTkM2aInH7ILZR9tdPVqQoN2QfV6d68moC4OSZdNTDRdehk8pt6BO-gWL7I4Z-gWwE6FCSo1w3DChSPAbASnVFKnZFCudYZRbOQe1klL8qRjGKORfo97nMfvDhMovUC3mvwD95LnfIBIPkNTMWXWz9d_NEhBzmPbIOAHwBD-D0dqjHWGgbMQIMDvfRYHGzWAxL6k7lFKSfHOewLLG6yUWFzCsKODBFBNK8x_MMLTvCDvhiwmxSofCkkJvVU87NYQAkXgwFmFZh8HH1EqF36ipyuXUgajjSU-r3gmnY3fc9PwoU55l8CIxM0t_jWX7sH2m2TCSqdNfL4ScKOzfB_xUwWkJKc492DxFX9nWlx8sNEq5RRb_oB_VYJ6NBdzzBgP8g7R5rVrdyDau7tzLhLeEsEvYvKfNvDZkaka4D8Z2Xrlt5-A8-FhQZV0NrqsZiaa9YVyzzsM1WwTpGGTJDHBIac2pgEt-ZaCaRZ5Ps6PbuNIsGfD0NyrUOgEuPhw4B0BI8o_L1dadyLbjaQsCCjbr44iQBIdkvt3KgWkpJomIkUqsY4svHO13ZgyMeK8lCEu2so5uMuiHtcqmmNUej2jSNZnwf2zGHEi3wrdYUIDaYMwySbfCTIwCBd-ykojvQUf3oyy860QGQkzKwZx2rf5CyTuCotMF4V_w_H5QtMmo023MhQoFE_tQPNlB3P-qH1eeEs7xhJR6ETphiVV0fDHYufStxQghxJwzExHIsDulVSz3LpQS5h0fE5qcV7dpz1V7jknVqJKQ-5yOBiM8_hbykvvIWS_F-wVC7rVkuGvjo5rJdte-7YLcprn75--OSN4CrwlNlesE4s2GyTA4FQKSyG87EdQYxxzHw045sCDWwP9lDRZbp2XfmZPSwUc697N_JIsohKhpg12M_DY71-zRgDqRnp73_Rx1-bKC1FatyCM5XuaifK8UysVZoqQLwAbuhIg_btUXexfukIP5A0TxY5N4X52l9L5ouCn3s9dML9ZaUjX0xSQ95q4vhA50d8SB5H8-NK9eYc7uziBRidqoWtUm_Yzo7ynCezkDC3JH5mqVLvyNIyanmfaechUKRDoyk2gIjIT88d7s2dwoYMwvBAyqedREFCMm464zBL0CuKJuRuOusNz3zcbEemjROTuB32vycGooxlUVWg4vW-l_AhCshi3rhYcxRTLaw8lbffZaFECgxLxSkhoBTkmaLuSTyVqIICxZy7bDfdjVukr1lYAs7Q85McbsGRtbJjceRWRXdOA4hJeNqaRqTWrzVck39UHQzfaTPAb2fAfBdx95ODmDCgRY9TR9_OAy0v0OUDh4Ce7x4SQ_eVEszuAqpYtokueokRXUVBOJU1ZNndkqrNORuvxKwt30K_mx4haS2VN8HY2Hb8MnY7-L5qoelNIQPxTvte6U-pyoQh6SYvb3JIugrhwy-tN2kq-1E7AH3r_maF49bjhqi2MeYEmmidaHAoN3MHz7NpiUP0Mx9q--cNo9OnHegapKsj-km29-XU80O4J1GSw0xjZ3YD17OzDg6ToZftPgNylONHSXD9wcCpdQZiYhppY8olO90dUfcGr2sWpyeiaoGrz4DRTdoCVa-Ey7P8Us-DmHpe9FTwnxbqdMjfkx8jieRq8UcVA9Bsp9w2nhXHxKHBv08WQMoU_-FAIcKQy9pH6GaOdJ_vvYhvhdoThb1hXmb23y29N_Lp4Z51_MA6xqPWWnKoyizrYn7UXZrtUqyaf3eWBSNQcsicyUaV-jO775yj1P17AfCUBwozPhhMKgSA3O3E1R3shGWN87YGTA_JtvyYO7NlziISK7jAiCqorCet6LSDbrWfzmEKOhjXvWX--KfzkUkId-J4NK5fipmGX40E0RvDiL9j3kMEIJ9jvKbLb2B-38IRBQMHQ16gPmuKwMrhndu2Ww6Y2jF48IjQPo29SoYvDr2pbHNrjqHfqzL1ESkhI13wr4CSgKCLKc5WDfk9YYQBGvHkHcUn0Kybj2xWL3rxLZwnqXYEetgv4i25xG4aavlCyKkEFd_W9N_SSH7JxqWnL9WJhU-FjUAl_UnK4PqkTk7q3a5Zt0nxeeZA-rBdVdcptZ_jh36NQ7oqtgxTS-_qw5eZZWx5ieYabJwcnBvgoXV5NpXkAIDIsjBRAIjgiQAkBxxc6Vcl7SEDrgchVO7-xd0klbo3Mnwz5IuqHLUaqPoyOAwnDkX0M25N8uvnharp5w6dbhJbPfdjt_v8-UqXnr3kIvP2z5LLcoDeDPTVHkkCFjHugUZ7Ro8cbg2_IstNynVL7OwIjvmKwX8to4GYSZtsCpG83GDS8W4GmV1zX1aAgkftO3MuwRs8AscOpBKEUYeQ9m05kQxmr4UllKAmEO_Nn_PvUT6ET-_k6vigpBMc5aFopQrC_O5tRyNArbyhe_KXmq8fRd3EoO74b69Aa-SBTR9yinhUVW3UmOQ5e76y_jk4E7l0dLgErfWOJmoEo6hAzJ4hitUosFdd64IRvMxQ7oWwBjeHfFrtCgML2KctySsYZkcijhqNxzBIPhbOLrDzZKNn_Y-z5FfhU_iDOOU8tyWdC3Y5wbc3PbXWpLduCP9akdEVu4mNVn8goKNrhZM4P3I3YKiRqz28glDDK-hL9X_W2EOEK_SA0njimd8GW6UIoDuRDDG_2pxKSYkkrWqt1LKSK5E-eI5MlBYiJ8GK3UuOaOPZv8ZT1IfWDfP-ciQm-dXmHq9mEhR9vNRkcLaHGZgi7Fk5MGx1xvS_j7Rv81SqPkm0df-_9PBh3lyMEuw0-8XVtyKCqiQZ1Wt9-ZjS_GKe4LDOxfeU7LFdps5lm_GI7so2m0aInKqT5cP7jn5gdXRQZqvc33Gr-WNY4eHTBSNpx7VBk5NHyxUU2rGBfzLN7lRMo71VelN43tBURG5kt39iYMcMvB2k7SOJV9wlT67kZj_eiyMshtWc3E899o-78S5PNnPJpzDa9S50aze0HmsvBTpH7Jod_zQLAWq8xgGXm2IKxyXscpxkza3TRGV96tFMoUL_cIvA9431-yHKRyNW890A95OohPngx4YHtJBED11h9c4DzmuftHXiH3JlseYuEEnlSu_bjqHCF-VwL3vS2ncAURw0IZsLV1JaguWoUhx5HoqJVpVCs2n8SCWW63iHRQ9BFiFG6QbpmR7K"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
