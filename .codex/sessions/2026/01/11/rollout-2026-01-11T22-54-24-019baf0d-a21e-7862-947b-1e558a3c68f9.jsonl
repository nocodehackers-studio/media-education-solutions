Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

PROJECT_INDEX.md with supabase client in lib/ section\n  - [x] 8.2 Add Edge Functions section (placeholder for future)\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Previous Story Learnings (Story 1.1)\n\n**Established Patterns:**\n- React 19.2.3 with TypeScript strict mode\n- Path aliases: `@/*` → `./src/*` (configured in vite.config.ts and tsconfig.json)\n- shadcn/ui: new-york style, neutral base color\n- ESLint: modern flat config (`eslint.config.js`, not `.eslintrc.cjs`)\n- Placeholder exports use `export {}` pattern\n- PROJECT_INDEX.md exists at root for LLM discoverability\n\n**File Locations Established:**\n- `src/lib/index.ts` - exports utils (cn helper)\n- `src/lib/utils.ts` - cn() helper from shadcn\n- `src/types/index.ts` - shared types placeholder\n- `.env.example` - has placeholder for VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY\n\n### Supabase Client Setup\n\n**Create `src/lib/supabase.ts`:**\n```typescript\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';\nimport type { Database } from '@/types/supabase';\n\nconst supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;\nconst supabaseAnonKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;\n\nif (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseAnonKey) {\n  throw new Error('Missing Supabase environment variables');\n}\n\nexport const supabase = createClient<Database>(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);\n```\n\n**Create `src/types/supabase.ts` (placeholder):**\n```typescript\n// Database types will be generated via: npx supabase gen types typescript\n// For now, use a minimal placeholder\n\nexport type Database = {\n  public: {\n    Tables: {\n      profiles: {\n        Row: {\n          id: string;\n          email: string;\n          role: 'admin' | 'judge';\n          first_name: string | null;\n          last_name: string | null;\n          created_at: string;\n        };\n        Insert: {\n          id: string;\n          email: string;\n          role?: 'admin' | 'judge';\n          first_name?: string | null;\n          last_name?: string | null;\n          created_at?: string;\n        };\n        Update: {\n          email?: string;\n          role?: 'admin' | 'judge';\n          first_name?: string | null;\n          last_name?: string | null;\n        };\n      };\n    };\n  };\n};\n```\n\n**Update `src/lib/index.ts`:**\n```typescript\n// === Utilities ===\nexport { cn } from './utils';\n\n// === Supabase ===\nexport { supabase } from './supabase';\n```\n\n### Database Migration\n\n**Create `supabase/migrations/00001_create_profiles.sql`:**\n```sql\n-- Create profiles table (linked to auth.users)\nCREATE TABLE public.profiles (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  email TEXT NOT NULL,\n  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'judge')),\n  first_name TEXT,\n  last_name TEXT,\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() NOT NULL\n);\n\n-- Enable Row Level Security\nALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;\n\n-- Policy: Users can read their own profile\nCREATE POLICY \"Users can read own profile\"\n  ON public.profiles\n  FOR SELECT\n  USING (auth.uid() = id);\n\n-- Policy: Users can update their own profile (limited fields)\nCREATE POLICY \"Users can update own profile\"\n  ON public.profiles\n  FOR UPDATE\n  USING (auth.uid() = id)\n  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);\n\n-- Policy: Admins can read all profiles\nCREATE POLICY \"Admins can read all profiles\"\n  ON public.profiles\n  FOR SELECT\n  USING (\n    EXISTS (\n      SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles\n      WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'\n    )\n  );\n\n-- Function to handle new user signup\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()\nRETURNS TRIGGER AS $$\nBEGIN\n  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email, role)\n  VALUES (\n    NEW.id,\n    NEW.email,\n    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'role', 'judge')\n  );\n  RETURN NEW;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;\n\n-- Trigger to create profile on user signup\nCREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created\n  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users\n  FOR EACH ROW\n  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();\n\n-- Create index for common queries\nCREATE INDEX idx_profiles_role ON public.profiles(role);\nCREATE INDEX idx_profiles_email ON public.profiles(email);\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\n\n**Update `.env.example`:**\n```env\n# Supabase\nVITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co\nVITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key\n\n# Sentry (required in Story 1.5)\nVITE_SENTRY_DSN=\n\n# Server-side only (Edge Functions)\n# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key\n```\n\n**Create `.env.local` (gitignored, actual values):**\n```env\nVITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co\nVITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGc...\n```\n\n### Supabase CLI Commands\n\n```bash\n# Initialize Supabase in project (creates supabase/ folder)\nnpx supabase init\n\n# Link to remote project (get project ref from Supabase dashboard)\nnpx supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref\n\n# Push migrations to remote database\nnpx supabase db push\n\n# Generate TypeScript types from schema\nnpx supabase gen types typescript --linked > src/types/supabase.ts\n\n# Start local Supabase (for local development)\nnpx supabase start\n\n# Stop local Supabase\nnpx supabase stop\n```\n\n### RLS Testing\n\n**Test unauthenticated access (should fail):**\n```typescript\n// In browser console or test file\nimport { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';\n\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.from('profiles').select('*');\nconsole.log({ data, error }); // Should return empty data or error\n```\n\n**Test authenticated access:**\n```typescript\n// After signing in\nconst { data: user } = await supabase.auth.getUser();\nconst { data: profile } = await supabase\n  .from('profiles')\n  .select('*')\n  .eq('id', user.user?.id)\n  .single();\nconsole.log({ profile }); // Should return user's profile\n```\n\n### Project Structure After This Story\n\n```\nmedia-education-solutions/\n├── supabase/\n│   ├──

SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to client**\n   - Only use in Edge Functions (server-side)\n   - VITE_* prefix = exposed to client\n   - No prefix = server-side only\n\n2. **Always use typed client**\n   - Import `Database` type for full TypeScript support\n   - Generate types after schema changes: `npx supabase gen types typescript`\n\n3. **RLS is mandatory**\n   - Never disable RLS on tables with user data\n   - Test policies before deploying\n\n4. **Profile creation is automatic**\n   - Auth trigger handles profile row creation\n   - Default role is 'judge' (admin must be set manually in DB)\n\n### Import Pattern\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Import from lib index\nimport { supabase } from '@/lib';\n\n// ✅ ALSO CORRECT - Direct import if needed\nimport { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Never import createClient directly in components\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';\n```\n\n### References\n\n- [Source:

Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n- Build successful with 0 errors\n- TypeScript compilation passed\n- ESLint passed (1 pre-existing warning in button.tsx unrelated to changes)\n- Migration `00001_create_profiles.sql` applied successfully to Supabase\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n1. **AC1 (Supabase Client Configured):** Created typed Supabase client at `src/lib/supabase.ts` with Database type inference. Exported via `src/lib/index.ts` for clean imports.\n\n2. **AC2 (Profiles Table Schema):** Migration creates profiles table with all specified columns: id (UUID PK with FK to auth.users), email, role (CHECK constraint for 'admin'|'judge'), first_name, last_name, created_at. Indexes added for role and email.\n\n3. **AC3 (Auth Trigger):** `handle_new_user()` function and `on_auth_user_created` trigger automatically create profile row on user signup with default role 'judge'.\n\n4. **AC4 (Row Level Security):** RLS enabled with 3 policies: users read own profile, users update own profile, admins read all profiles.\n\n5. **AC5 (Environment Variables):** `.env.example` updated with example URLs, `.env.local` created (gitignored) for actual credentials.\n\n### Change Log\n\n| Date | Change | Files |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| 2026-01-11 | Installed @supabase/supabase-js@^2.90.1 | package.json |\n| 2026-01-11 | Created typed Supabase client | src/lib/supabase.ts |\n| 2026-01-11 | Created Database types placeholder | src/types/supabase.ts |\n| 2026-01-11 | Added supabase export to lib index | src/lib/index.ts |\n| 2026-01-11 | Added Database type export | src/types/index.ts |\n| 2026-01-11 | Initialized Supabase project structure | supabase/ |\n| 2026-01-11 | Created profiles migration with RLS | supabase/migrations/00001_create_profiles.sql |\n| 2026-01-11 | Updated env example with Supabase vars | .env.example |\n| 2026-01-11 | Created local env file | .env.local |\n| 2026-01-11 | Updated PROJECT_INDEX with supabase info | PROJECT_INDEX.md |\n\n### File List\n\nFiles created/modified:\n- src/lib/supabase.ts (NEW)\n- src/types/supabase.ts (NEW)\n- src/lib/index.ts (UPDATED - added supabase export)\n- src/types/index.ts (UPDATED - added Database type export)\n- supabase/config.toml (GENERATED by supabase init)\n- supabase/migrations/00001_create_profiles.sql (NEW)\n- .env.example (UPDATED - added Supabase vars with examples)\n- .env.local (NEW - gitignored, contains actual credentials)\n- PROJECT_INDEX.md (UPDATED - added supabase to lib section, added Database section)\n- package.json (UPDATED - added @supabase/supabase-js dependency)\n- package-lock.json (UPDATED - dependency lock)\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read this FIRST before any implementation work._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n| Category | Technology | Version |\n|----------|------------|---------|\n| Framework | React | 19 |\n| Build | Vite | 6+ |\n| Language | TypeScript | Strict mode |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS | v4 |\n| Components | shadcn/ui | Latest |\n| Backend | Supabase | Auth + PostgreSQL + Edge Functions |\n| Server State | TanStack Query | Latest |\n| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod | Latest |\n| Routing | React Router DOM | v6+ |\n| Monitoring | Sentry | Latest |\n\n**External Services:**\n- Bunny Stream (video storage/streaming)\n- Bunny Storage (photos/assets)\n- Brevo (transactional email)\n\n---\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Feature Architecture (MOST IMPORTANT)\n\n**Mandatory Index Files:**\n```typescript\n// Every feature folder MUST have index.ts exporting ALL contents\n// features/submissions/index.ts\n\n// === Components ===\nexport { UploadProgress } from './components/UploadProgress';\nexport { SubmissionCard } from './components/SubmissionCard';\n\n// === Hooks ===\nexport { useSubmissions } from './hooks/useSubmissions';\n\n// === API ===\nexport { submissionsApi } from './api/submissionsApi';\n\n// === Types ===\nexport type { Submission, SubmissionStatus } from './types/submission.types';\n```\n\n**Import Rules:**\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Always import from feature index\nimport { UploadProgress, useSubmissions } from '@/features/submissions';\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Never import from deep paths\nimport { UploadProgress } from '@/features/submissions/components/UploadProgress';\n```\n\n**After Creating Any New File:**\n1. Add export to the feature's `index.ts` immediately\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding new features or major components\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\n| Context | Convention | Example |\n|---------|------------|---------|\n| Database tables | snake_case, plural | `participants`, `contest_codes` |\n| Database columns | snake_case | `created_at`, `contest_id` |\n| TypeScript files | PascalCase (components), camelCase (utils) | `RatingScale.tsx`, `submissionsApi.ts` |\n| Functions/variables | camelCase | `getContests`, `isLoading` |\n| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE | `MAX_FILE_SIZE` |\n| Types/Interfaces | PascalCase | `Contest`, `SubmissionStatus` |\n| Hooks | use + PascalCase | `useContests`, `useFileUpload` |\n\n**Data Transformation:**\n- Database returns `snake_case` → Transform to `camelCase` in API layer\n- Never mix conventions within same layer\n\n### State Management Rules\n\n| State Type | Solution | Location |\n|------------|----------|----------|\n| Server data | TanStack Query | Feature hooks |\n| Form data | React Hook Form | Component-local |\n| Auth state | React Context | `AuthContext` |\n| Participant session | React Context | `ParticipantSessionContext` |\n| Local UI | useState | Component-local |\n\n**Never:**\n- Use useState for server data (use TanStack Query)\n- Create global state for form data\n- Mix state management solutions for same concern\n\n### Authentication Rules\n\n**Three Separate Auth Flows:**\n\n| Role | Method | Implementation |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| Admin | Email + Password | Supabase Auth |\n| Judge | Email + Password | Supabase Auth (invite flow) |\n| Participant | Contest Code + Participant Code | localStorage (NO Supabase account) |\n\n**Participant Session:**\n- Store codes in localStorage with `last_activity` timestamp\n- Expire after **120 minutes** of inactivity\n- Active upload keeps session alive\n- Clear on logout (shared device reminder)\n\n### Bunny Upload Security (CRITICAL)\n\n**Never expose Bunny credentials to client.**\n\n**Upload Flow:**\n1. Client requests signed URL from Edge Function\n2. Edge Function validates: participant codes, category open, within limits\n3. Edge Function returns short-lived signed URL\n4. Client uploads directly to Bunny using signed URL\n\n**Storage Path Pattern:**\n```\n/{contest_id}/{category_id}/{participant_code}/{filename}\n```\n\n### Anonymous Judging Rules\n\n**Judge queries must NEVER access participant PII.**\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Judge view query\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('id, media_url, participant_id')  // participant_id is UUID, not PII\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Joins to participant data\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('*, participants(name, organization)')  // EXPOSES PII\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\n**Use Standardized Error Codes:**\n```typescript\nimport { ERROR_CODES } from '@/lib/errorCodes';\n\n// Always use predefined codes\nthrow new AppError(ERROR_CODES.CATEGORY_CLOSED, 'Category deadline has passed');\n```\n\n**Error Codes Available:**\n- `INVALID_CODES`, `SESSION_EXPIRED`, `CONTEST_NOT_FOUND`\n- `CATEGORY_CLOSED`, `SUBMISSION_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`\n- `FILE_TOO_LARGE`, `INVALID_FILE_TYPE`\n- `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `SERVER_ERROR`\n\n### Component Structure\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Imports (React first, then external, then internal)\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui';\nimport { useContests } from '@/features/contests';\n\n// 2. Types (interface for props)\ninterface ContestCardProps {\n  contest: Contest;\n  onSelect: (id: string) => void;\n}\n\n// 3. Component (named export, not default)\nexport function ContestCard({ contest, onSelect }: ContestCardProps) {\n  // hooks first\n  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);\n\n  // handlers\n  const handleClick = () => onSelect(contest.id);\n\n  // render\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n**Co-locate tests with source:**\n```\nfeatures/submissions/components/\n├── UploadProgress.tsx\n├── UploadProgress.test.tsx  ← Same folder\n```\n\n**Test Naming:**\n- Unit tests: `{ComponentName}.test.tsx`\n- Integration tests: `{feature}.integration.test.ts`\n\n### Zod Schema Rules\n\n**Single Source of Truth:**\n```typescript\n// Define schema in types/ folder\n// features/contests/types/contest.schemas.ts\nexport const contestFormSchema = z.object({\n  name: z.string().min(1, 'Required'),\n  contestCode: z.string().length(6, 'Must be 6 digits'),\n});\n\n// Use in form AND API validation\n```\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)\n\n1. **Never import from deep paths** — Always use feature index\n2. **Never use useState for server data** — Use TanStack Query\n3. **Never expose Bunny credentials to client** — Use Edge Functions\n4. **Never join participant PII in judge queries** — Anonymous judging\n5. **Never skip index.ts updates** — Every export must be indexed\n6. **Never mix naming conventions** — snake_case DB, camelCase code\n7. **Never store participant passwords** — Code-only access\n8. **Never use default exports** — Named exports only\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n**Before implementing any feature:**\n1. Read `PROJECT_INDEX.md` at project root\n2. Read the feature's `index.ts` to understand existing exports\n3. Check architecture.md for patterns\n\n**After implementing:**\n1. Update feature's `index.ts` with new exports\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding major components\n3. Run type-check and lint before committing\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\n---\n\n_Last Updated: 2026-01-10_\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
