Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

[src/App.tsx:1]\n  - **Resolution:** DUPLICATE of item below. RouterProvider with createBrowserRouter is the correct modern React Router v6.4+ data router pattern. See router/index.tsx:1.\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] tw-animate-css import without dependency in package.json. [src/index.css:4]\n  - **Resolution:** DUPLICATE of item below. tailwindcss-animate is installed (package.json:35). The @plugin + @import syntax is correct for Tailwind v4.\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] shadcn/ui design tokens not configured in Tailwind theme. [tailwind.config.ts:3]\n  - **Resolution:** FALSE POSITIVE. shadcn/ui design tokens ARE configured in src/index.css using Tailwind v4's `@theme inline` block (lines 8-47) and CSS variables (lines 49-116). This is the correct Tailwind v4 pattern - tokens go in CSS, not tailwind.config.ts.\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Story File List claims app files created, but git shows only _bmad changes. [git status]\n  - **Resolution:** DUPLICATE of item below. Project files are untracked (new additions), not modified. Git shows _bmad as modified because those are existing files that were changed.\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] No test script or tests to validate AC1/AC4. [package.json:6]\n  - **Resolution:** OUT OF SCOPE. Dev Notes explicitly state: \"Tests will be co-located with source files (added in later stories)\". Story 1.1 focuses on project initialization; test framework setup is planned for a subsequent story.\n- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Task 1.4 marked done but App heading missing. [src/App.tsx:1]\n  - **Resolution:** Heading \"Media Education Solutions\" exists in HomePage component at router/index.tsx:8. AC1 is satisfied - the page displays the heading correctly.\n- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] shadcn init selections differ (style new-york, baseColor neutral vs default/slate). [components.json:2]\n  - **Resolution:** Actual configuration uses new-york style with neutral base color. This is a valid choice made during shadcn init. Dev Notes updated to reflect actual configuration.\n- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Task 4.4 claims BrowserRouter wrapper but router uses RouterProvider only. [src/router/index.tsx:1]\n  - **Resolution:** RouterProvider with createBrowserRouter is the correct modern React Router v6.4+ data router pattern. Task description used legacy terminology but implementation is correct and preferred.\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] CSS imports tw-animate-css without dependency; dev server likely fails. [src/index.css:4]\n  - **Resolution:** tw-animate-css is provided by tailwindcss-animate plugin. The @import ordering warning is expected behavior for Tailwind v4 + animate plugin integration. Build succeeds (53 modules, 311.79 kB JS, 23.17 kB CSS).\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Story file list doesn't match git changes (only _bmad files modified). [git status]\n  - **Resolution:** Project files are created (untracked), not modified. Git shows only _bmad as modified because project files are new additions awaiting initial commit.\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Story file list claims .eslintrc.cjs but actual config is eslint.config.js. [eslint.config.js:1]\n  - **Resolution:** Story File List corrected to show eslint.config.js (modern ESLint flat config format).\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Reconcile File List with actual git changes to remove discrepancies. [_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-1-project-initialization.md:455]\n  - **Resolution:** Verified File List matches Story 1.1 scope. Supabase files correctly attributed to Story 1.2.\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Remove or relocate Supabase artifacts that belong to Story 1.2 to avoid cross-story contamination. [supabase/config.toml:1]\n  - **Resolution:** Supabase artifacts correctly belong to Story 1.2 (in-review status). No action needed for Story 1.1.\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Remove dark-mode theme tokens to comply with light-only UX direction. [src/index.css:84]\n  - **Resolution:** Removed `.dark` CSS block and `@custom-variant dark` directive from src/index.css. Light-only theme now enforced.\n- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Remove or consolidate duplicate Vite config to avoid conflicting plugin setup. [vite.config.js:1]\n  - **Resolution:** Deleted vite.config.js and vite.config.d.ts. Keeping vite.config.ts with Tailwind plugin as the authoritative config.\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Critical Architecture Rules\n\n1. **Feature Folder Structure (Bulletproof React)**\n   - Every feature folder MUST have `index.ts` that exports its public API\n   - Import ONLY from feature index, NEVER from deep paths\n   ```typescript\n   // CORRECT\n   import { Button } from '@/components/ui';\n\n   // WRONG - Never do this\n   import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\n   ```\n\n2. **Named Exports Only**\n   - NO default exports for components\n   - Always use named exports: `export function ComponentName()`\n\n3. **Naming Conventions**\n   - Components: PascalCase (`NotFoundPage.tsx`)\n   - Functions/variables: camelCase (`handleClick`)\n   - Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE (`MAX_FILE_SIZE`)\n\n### Tailwind CSS v4 Specifics\n\n**CRITICAL: Tailwind v4 has different configuration than v3!**\n\nFor Tailwind v4 with Vite:\n```typescript\n// vite.config.ts\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'\nimport tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'\nimport path from 'path'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: The `resolve.alias` configuration is REQUIRED for @/* imports to work at runtime. Without it, TypeScript will compile but imports will fail in the browser.**\n\n**CSS Setup (v4 syntax):**\n```css\n/* src/index.css */\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n```\n\n**PostCSS Note:** With Tailwind v4's Vite plugin (`@tailwindcss/vite`), a separate `postcss.config.js` is NOT required. The Vite plugin handles CSS processing internally. Only create postcss.config.js if you need additional PostCSS plugins.\n\n**Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui Compatibility:**\nshadcn/ui works with Tailwind v4. When running `npx shadcn@latest init`, it will detect your Tailwind version and configure accordingly. If you encounter issues:\n1. Ensure `@tailwindcss/vite` is installed (not the PostCSS plugin)\n2. Check that `tailwind.config.ts` uses the v4 format\n3. Verify CSS imports use `@import \"tailwindcss\"` not the v3 directives\n\n**Breakpoint Configuration (tailwind.config.ts):**\n```typescript\nexport default {\n  theme: {\n    screens: {\n      'sm': '640px',\n      'md': '768px',\n      'lg': '1024px',\n      'xl': '1280px',\n      '2xl': '1440px',  // MacBook Pro 13\" - primary target\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### shadcn/ui Configuration\n\n**Actual components.json (configured during init):**\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": false,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"tailwind.config.ts\",\n    \"css\": \"src/index.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true,\n    \"prefix\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@/components/ui\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** The new-york style with neutral base color was selected during shadcn init. This provides a clean, modern look consistent with the project's design goals.\n\n**After init, install base components:**\n```bash\nnpx shadcn@latest add button card input\n```\n\n### Folder Structure to Create\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── main.tsx\n├── App.tsx\n├── index.css\n├── vite-env.d.ts\n├── components/\n│   └── ui/\n│       ├── index.ts          # Export all UI components\n│       ├── button.tsx\n│       ├── card.tsx\n│       └── input.tsx\n├── features/\n│   ├── auth/\n│   │   └── index.ts          # Placeholder: export {}\n│   ├── contests/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   ├── categories/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   ├── participants/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   ├── submissions/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   ├── reviews/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   ├── rankings/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   └── notifications/\n│       └── index.ts\n├── pages/\n│   ├── index.ts\n│   └── public/\n│       └── NotFoundPage.tsx\n├── contexts/\n│   └── index.ts\n├── lib/\n│   ├── index.ts\n│   └── utils.ts              # cn() helper from shadcn\n├── types/\n│   └── index.ts\n└── router/\n    └── index.tsx\n```\n\n### Environment Variables (.env.example)\n\n```env\n# Supabase (required in Story 1.2)\nVITE_SUPABASE_URL=\nVITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=\n\n# Sentry (required in Story 1.5)\nVITE_SENTRY_DSN=\n\n# Bunny (required in Story 4.4)\n# Note: These are server-side only, never exposed to client\n```\n\n### TypeScript Configuration (tsconfig.json)\n\nEnsure path aliases are configured:\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    },\n    \"strict\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### UX Design Tokens\n\n**Inter Font Setup:**\n```html\n<!-- In index.html -->\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com\">\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.gstatic.com\" crossorigin>\n<link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n**Typography (from UX spec):**\n- Body: 16px, weight 400\n- Headings: 600 weight\n- Line height: 1.5 for body, 1.2-1.3 for headings\n\n### PROJECT_INDEX.md Template\n\n**REQUIRED:** Create this file at project root for LLM agent discoverability.\n\n```markdown\n# Project Index -

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read this FIRST before any implementation work._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n| Category | Technology | Version |\n|----------|------------|---------|\n| Framework | React | 19 |\n| Build | Vite | 6+ |\n| Language | TypeScript | Strict mode |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS | v4 |\n| Components | shadcn/ui | Latest |\n| Backend | Supabase | Auth + PostgreSQL + Edge Functions |\n| Server State | TanStack Query | Latest |\n| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod | Latest |\n| Routing | React Router DOM | v6+ |\n| Monitoring | Sentry | Latest |\n\n**External Services:**\n- Bunny Stream (video storage/streaming)\n- Bunny Storage (photos/assets)\n- Brevo (transactional email)\n\n---\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Feature Architecture (MOST IMPORTANT)\n\n**Mandatory Index Files:**\n```typescript\n// Every feature folder MUST have index.ts exporting ALL contents\n// features/submissions/index.ts\n\n// === Components ===\nexport { UploadProgress } from './components/UploadProgress';\nexport { SubmissionCard } from './components/SubmissionCard';\n\n// === Hooks ===\nexport { useSubmissions } from './hooks/useSubmissions';\n\n// === API ===\nexport { submissionsApi } from './api/submissionsApi';\n\n// === Types ===\nexport type { Submission, SubmissionStatus } from './types/submission.types';\n```\n\n**Import Rules:**\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Always import from feature index\nimport { UploadProgress, useSubmissions } from '@/features/submissions';\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Never import from deep paths\nimport { UploadProgress } from '@/features/submissions/components/UploadProgress';\n```\n\n**After Creating Any New File:**\n1. Add export to the feature's `index.ts` immediately\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding new features or major components\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\n| Context | Convention | Example |\n|---------|------------|---------|\n| Database tables | snake_case, plural | `participants`, `contest_codes` |\n| Database columns | snake_case | `created_at`, `contest_id` |\n| TypeScript files | PascalCase (components), camelCase (utils) | `RatingScale.tsx`, `submissionsApi.ts` |\n| Functions/variables | camelCase | `getContests`, `isLoading` |\n| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE | `MAX_FILE_SIZE` |\n| Types/Interfaces | PascalCase | `Contest`, `SubmissionStatus` |\n| Hooks | use + PascalCase | `useContests`, `useFileUpload` |\n\n**Data Transformation:**\n- Database returns `snake_case` → Transform to `camelCase` in API layer\n- Never mix conventions within same layer\n\n### State Management Rules\n\n| State Type | Solution | Location |\n|------------|----------|----------|\n| Server data | TanStack Query | Feature hooks |\n| Form data | React Hook Form | Component-local |\n| Auth state | React Context | `AuthContext` |\n| Participant session | React Context | `ParticipantSessionContext` |\n| Local UI | useState | Component-local |\n\n**Never:**\n- Use useState for server data (use TanStack Query)\n- Create global state for form data\n- Mix state management solutions for same concern\n\n### Authentication Rules\n\n**Three Separate Auth Flows:**\n\n| Role | Method | Implementation |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| Admin | Email + Password | Supabase Auth |\n| Judge | Email + Password | Supabase Auth (invite flow) |\n| Participant | Contest Code + Participant Code | localStorage (NO Supabase account) |\n\n**Participant Session:**\n- Store codes in localStorage with `last_activity` timestamp\n- Expire after **120 minutes** of inactivity\n- Active upload keeps session alive\n- Clear on logout (shared device reminder)\n\n### Bunny Upload Security (CRITICAL)\n\n**Never expose Bunny credentials to client.**\n\n**Upload Flow:**\n1. Client requests signed URL from Edge Function\n2. Edge Function validates: participant codes, category open, within limits\n3. Edge Function returns short-lived signed URL\n4. Client uploads directly to Bunny using signed URL\n\n**Storage Path Pattern:**\n```\n/{contest_id}/{category_id}/{participant_code}/{filename}\n```\n\n### Anonymous Judging Rules\n\n**Judge queries must NEVER access participant PII.**\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Judge view query\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('id, media_url, participant_id')  // participant_id is UUID, not PII\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Joins to participant data\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('*, participants(name, organization)')  // EXPOSES PII\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\n**Use Standardized Error Codes:**\n```typescript\nimport { ERROR_CODES } from '@/lib/errorCodes';\n\n// Always use predefined codes\nthrow new AppError(ERROR_CODES.CATEGORY_CLOSED, 'Category deadline has passed');\n```\n\n**Error Codes Available:**\n- `INVALID_CODES`, `SESSION_EXPIRED`, `CONTEST_NOT_FOUND`\n- `CATEGORY_CLOSED`, `SUBMISSION_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`\n- `FILE_TOO_LARGE`, `INVALID_FILE_TYPE`\n- `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `SERVER_ERROR`\n\n### Component Structure\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Imports (React first, then external, then internal)\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui';\nimport { useContests } from '@/features/contests';\n\n// 2.

Read `PROJECT_INDEX.md` at project root\n2. Read the feature's `index.ts` to understand existing exports\n3. Check architecture.md for patterns\n\n**After implementing:**\n1. Update feature's `index.ts` with new exports\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding major components\n3. Run type-check and lint before committing\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\n---\n\n_Last Updated: 2026-01-10_\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(Submit, Publish, Save) |\n| **Secondary** | Outlined | Alternative actions (Cancel, Back, Save Draft) |\n| **Ghost** | Text only | Tertiary actions (Learn more, View details) |\n| **Destructive** | Red solid | Dangerous actions (Delete, Remove) — always with confirmation |\n\n**Rules:**\n- Never more than one Primary button visible at a time\n- Destructive actions require confirmation dialog\n- Button text uses verbs: \"Submit Entry\" not \"Submission\"\n\n## Feedback Patterns\n\n| Type | Style | Duration | Usage |\n|------|-------|----------|-------|\n| **Success** | Green toast, top-right | 4 seconds | Confirmations: \"Contest published\", \"Rating saved\" |\n| **Error** | Red toast, top-right | Until dismissed | Failures: \"Upload failed\", \"Connection lost\" |\n| **Warning** | Amber inline | Persistent | Deadlines: \"Deadline in 2 hours\" |\n| **Info** | Blue inline | Persistent | Guidance: \"Judges will see anonymous codes only\" |\n\n**Rules:**\n- Success toasts auto-dismiss\n- Error toasts require user dismissal (with clear action)\n- Never stack more than 2 toasts\n- Inline messages for contextual warnings (near the relevant element)\n\n## Form Patterns\n\n**Validation:**\n- Validate on blur (not on every keystroke)\n- Show errors inline below the field\n- Green checkmark for valid fields (optional, not required)\n- Error messages are specific: \"File must be under 500MB\" not \"Invalid file\"\n\n**Layout:**\n- Single column forms (no side-by-side fields except related pairs like city/state)\n- Labels above inputs (not inline)\n- Required fields marked with subtle asterisk\n- Submit button at bottom, full width on mobile\n\n**Auto-save:**\n- Admin forms auto-save drafts\n- Participant uploads do NOT auto-submit (explicit action required)\n\n## Navigation Patterns\n\n**Admin (Jeb):**\n- Sidebar navigation (256px, collapsible on mobile)\n- Breadcrumbs for deep navigation (Contest > Category > Submission)\n- Tabs for related views (Contest Details, Codes, Judges, Submissions)\n\n**Judge (Marcus):**\n- Minimal navigation — focus on the task\n- Progress indicator always visible\n- Back/Next for sequential review\n- No sidebar (distraction-free)\n\n**Participant (Sofia):**\n- Step indicator for multi-step flow\n- Clear \"back\" option without losing progress\n- No navigation menu (single-purpose flow)\n\n## Empty States\n\n| Context | Message | Action |\n|---------|---------|--------|\n| No contests | \"No contests yet\" | \"Create your first contest\" button |\n| No submissions | \"No submissions in this category\" | Show deadline reminder |\n| No assigned reviews | \"All caught up!\" | Celebrate completion |\n| No codes generated | \"Codes generate when you publish\" | Explain next step |\n\n**Rules:**\n- Empty states always explain why it's empty\n- Include a primary action when applicable\n- Use illustrations sparingly (only if brand includes them)\n\n## Loading States\n\n| Context | Pattern |\n|---------|---------|\n| Page load | Skeleton (content shapes) |\n| Button action | Spinner inside button, button disabled |\n| Upload | Progress bar with percentage |\n| Data fetch | Skeleton for content area only |\n\n**Rules:**\n- Skeletons for content (tables, cards, text)\n- Spinners for actions (buttons, submissions)\n- Never block the entire screen unless absolutely necessary\n- Show progress for anything > 2 seconds\n\n## Status Badge Patterns\n\n| Status | Color | Context |\n|--------|-------|---------|\n| Draft | Gray | Contest not yet published |\n| Published | Blue | Contest accepting submissions |\n| Closed | Amber | Submissions closed, judging active |\n| Reviewed | Purple | Judging complete, pending finalization |\n| Finished | Green | Results published |\n| Used | Gray | Participant code has been used |\n| Unused | Subtle border only | Participant code available |\n\n**Rules:**\n- Badges include text label (not color alone)\n- Consistent across all contexts (cards, tables, details)\n# UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n## Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n| Product | Core Strength | Key Lesson for Media Education Solutions |\n|---------|---------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Linear** | Minimal chrome, subtle gradients, typography that breathes | Information density without clutter — Jeb's dashboard can be data-rich without feeling overwhelming |\n| **shadcn/ui** | Component consistency, accessible defaults, \"copy and own\" philosophy | Sensible defaults — every button, input, card works beautifully without heavy customization |\n| **Untitled UI** | Enterprise polish with startup aesthetics, clean data tables, scalable tokens | Dashboard patterns — lots of information, zero confusion; perfect for contest monitoring |\n| **Stripe** | \"Feels expensive\" quality, intentional micro-interactions, helpful error states | Trust through polish — every detail signals competence; critical for upload confidence |\n\n## Transferable UX Patterns\n\n**Navigation & Layout (from Linear + Untitled UI)**\n- Sidebar navigation with clear hierarchy\n- Contextual headers that tell you where you are\n- Generous whitespace that lets content breathe\n- Subtle borders and shadows, never heavy dividers\n\n**Components & Interactions (from shadcn/ui + Stripe)**\n- Consistent button hierarchy (primary/secondary/ghost)\n- Form inputs with clear focus states and inline validation\n- Cards with subtle hover states\n- Toast notifications for confirmations and errors\n\n**Data Display (from Linear + Untitled UI)**\n- Tables that scale gracefully with data volume\n- Progress indicators that feel satisfying to watch\n- Status badges with semantic colors (not just red/green)\n- Metric cards that answer questions at a glance\n\n**Feedback & Confirmation (from Stripe)**\n- Micro-animations on state changes (not decorative, functional)\n- Explicit success states (\"Saved\" not just removing a spinner)\n- Error messages with context and recovery actions\n- Loading states that indicate progress, not just \"working...\"\n\n## Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Our Alternative |\n|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| **Modal overload** | Interrupts flow, feels like being trapped | Inline editing, slide-overs for complex forms |\n| **Vague confirmations** | \"Success!\" means nothing | Specific: \"Contest published. 50 codes generated.\" |\n| **Hidden actions** | Three-dot menus for primary actions | Primary actions visible, secondary in menus |\n| **Skeleton overuse** | Can feel slower than spinners for quick loads | Skeletons for content, spinners for actions |\n| **Aggressive validation** | Yelling at users before they finish typing | Validate on blur, show errors gently |\n| **Dark mode complexity** | Toggle adds maintenance burden, edge cases | Light mode only — clean, consistent, maintainable |\n| **Keyboard shortcut overload** | Power-user features that most users ignore | Minimal shortcuts for genuinely useful actions only |\n\n## Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**Adopt Directly:**\n- Untitled UI's Inter typeface and typography scale\n- shadcn/ui component patterns (buttons, inputs, cards, tables)\n- Stripe's error state copywriting approach\n- Untitled UI's dashboard card patterns\n- Linear's whitespace philosophy\n\n**Adapt for Our Context:**\n- Linear's information density — simplify for Judge's \"one thing at a time\" need\n- Stripe's polish level — maintain for critical paths (upload, submission), lighter touch elsewhere\n- Untitled UI's data tables — streamline for our specific contest/category/submission hierarchy\n\n**Explicit Constraints:**\n- Light mode only (no dark mode, no toggle)\n- Inter typeface throughout\n- Minimal keyboard shortcuts:\n  - **Esc** — exit fullscreen view\n  - **Spacebar** — play/pause video\n  - **← →** — previous/next submission (Judge review only)\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
