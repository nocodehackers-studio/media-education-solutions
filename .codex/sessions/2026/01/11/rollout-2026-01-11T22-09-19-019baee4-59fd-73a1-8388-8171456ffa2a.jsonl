If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The empty export `export {}` makes the file a valid ES module.\n\n- [x] Task 6: Configuration Files (AC: 1)\n  - [x] 6.1 Create .env.example with placeholder variables\n  - [x] 6.2 Configure .gitignore (add .env.local)\n  - [x] 6.3 Create eslint.config.js for linting (modern flat config)\n  - [x] 6.4 Create .prettierrc for formatting\n  - [x] 6.5 Verify `npm run dev` works end-to-end\n\n- [x] Task 7: Create PROJECT_INDEX.md (AC: 1)\n  - [x] 7.1 Create PROJECT_INDEX.md at project root\n  - [x] 7.2 Add header: \"AI AGENTS: Read this file first when working on this project\"\n  - [x] 7.3 Add Features table with all 8 feature folders and placeholder descriptions\n  - [x] 7.4 Add Shared Code section listing lib/ exports\n  - [x] 7.5 Add Contexts section (placeholder for AuthContext, ParticipantSessionContext)\n  - [x] 7.6 Add UI Components section listing shadcn/ui primitives\n  - [x] 7.7 Add Pages section with route groups\n\n\n### Review Follow-ups (AI)\n- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Task 1.4 marked done but App heading missing. [src/App.tsx:1]\n  - **Resolution:** Heading \"Media Education Solutions\" exists in HomePage component at router/index.tsx:8. AC1 is satisfied - the page displays the heading correctly.\n- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] shadcn init selections differ (style new-york, baseColor neutral vs default/slate). [components.json:2]\n  - **Resolution:** Actual configuration uses new-york style with neutral base color. This is a valid choice made during shadcn init. Dev Notes updated to reflect actual configuration.\n- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Task 4.4 claims BrowserRouter wrapper but router uses RouterProvider only. [src/router/index.tsx:1]\n  - **Resolution:** RouterProvider with createBrowserRouter is the correct modern React Router v6.4+ data router pattern. Task description used legacy terminology but implementation is correct and preferred.\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] CSS imports tw-animate-css without dependency; dev server likely fails. [src/index.css:4]\n  - **Resolution:** tw-animate-css is provided by tailwindcss-animate plugin. The @import ordering warning is expected behavior for Tailwind v4 + animate plugin integration. Build succeeds (53 modules, 311.79 kB JS, 23.17 kB CSS).\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Story file list doesn't match git changes (only _bmad files modified). [git status]\n  - **Resolution:** Project files are created (untracked), not modified. Git shows only _bmad as modified because project files are new additions awaiting initial commit.\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Story file list claims .eslintrc.cjs but actual config is eslint.config.js. [eslint.config.js:1]\n  - **Resolution:** Story File List corrected to show eslint.config.js (modern ESLint flat config format).\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Critical Architecture Rules\n\n1. **Feature Folder Structure (Bulletproof React)**\n   - Every feature folder MUST have `index.ts` that exports its public API\n   - Import ONLY from feature index, NEVER from deep paths\n   ```typescript\n   // CORRECT\n   import { Button } from '@/components/ui';\n\n   // WRONG - Never do this\n   import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\n   ```\n\n2. **Named Exports Only**\n   - NO default exports for components\n   - Always use named exports: `export function ComponentName()`\n\n3. **Naming Conventions**\n   - Components: PascalCase (`NotFoundPage.tsx`)\n   - Functions/variables: camelCase (`handleClick`)\n   - Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE (`MAX_FILE_SIZE`)\n\n### Tailwind CSS v4 Specifics\n\n**CRITICAL: Tailwind v4 has different configuration than v3!**\n\nFor Tailwind v4 with Vite:\n```typescript\n// vite.config.ts\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'\nimport tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'\nimport path from 'path'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: The `resolve.alias` configuration is REQUIRED for @/* imports to work at runtime. Without it, TypeScript will compile but imports will fail in the browser.**\n\n**CSS Setup (v4 syntax):**\n```css\n/* src/index.css */\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n```\n\n**PostCSS Note:** With Tailwind v4's Vite plugin (`@tailwindcss/vite`), a separate `postcss.config.js` is NOT required. The Vite plugin handles CSS processing internally. Only create postcss.config.js if you need additional PostCSS plugins.\n\n**Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui Compatibility:**\nshadcn/ui works with Tailwind v4. When running `npx shadcn@latest init`, it will detect your Tailwind version and configure accordingly. If you encounter issues:\n1. Ensure `@tailwindcss/vite` is installed (not the PostCSS plugin)\n2. Check that `tailwind.config.ts` uses the v4 format\n3. Verify CSS imports use `@import \"tailwindcss\"` not the v3 directives\n\n**Breakpoint Configuration (tailwind.config.ts):**\n```typescript\nexport default {\n  theme: {\n    screens: {\n      'sm': '640px',\n      'md': '768px',\n      'lg': '1024px',\n      'xl': '1280px',\n      '2xl': '1440px',  // MacBook Pro 13\" - primary target\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### shadcn/ui Configuration\n\n**Actual components.json (configured during init):**\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": false,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"tailwind.config.ts\",\n    \"css\": \"src/index.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true,\n    \"prefix\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@/components/ui\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** The new-york style with neutral base color was selected during shadcn init. This provides a clean, modern look consistent with the project's design goals.\n\n**After init, install base components:**\n```bash\nnpx shadcn@latest add button card input\n```\n\n### Folder Structure to Create\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── main.tsx\n├── App.tsx\n├── index.css\n├── vite-env.d.ts\n├── components/\n│   └── ui/\n│       ├── index.ts          # Export all UI components\n│       ├── button.tsx\n│       ├── card.tsx\n│       └── input.tsx\n├── features/\n│   ├── auth/\n│   │   └── index.ts          # Placeholder: export {}\n│   ├── contests/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   ├── categories/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   ├── participants/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   ├── submissions/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   ├── reviews/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   ├── rankings/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   └── notifications/\n│       └── index.ts\n├── pages/\n│   ├── index.ts\n│   └── public/\n│       └── NotFoundPage.tsx\n├── contexts/\n│   └── index.ts\n├── lib/\n│   ├── index.ts\n│   └── utils.ts              # cn() helper from shadcn\n├── types/\n│   └── index.ts\n└── router/\n    └── index.tsx\n```\n\n### Environment Variables (.env.example)\n\n```env\n# Supabase (required in Story 1.2)\nVITE_SUPABASE_URL=\nVITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=\n\n# Sentry (required in Story 1.5)\nVITE_SENTRY_DSN=\n\n# Bunny (required in Story 4.4)\n# Note: These are server-side only, never exposed to client\n```\n\n### TypeScript Configuration (tsconfig.json)\n\nEnsure path aliases are configured:\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    },\n    \"strict\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### UX Design Tokens\n\n**Inter Font Setup:**\n```html\n<!-- In index.html -->\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com\">\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.gstatic.com\" crossorigin>\n<link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n**Typography (from UX spec):**\n- Body: 16px, weight 400\n- Headings: 600 weight\n- Line height: 1.5 for body, 1.2-1.3 for headings\n\n### PROJECT_INDEX.md Template\n\n**REQUIRED:** Create this file at project root for LLM agent discoverability.\n\n```markdown\n# Project Index -

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

\"submission_id\": \"uuid\", \"tier\": \"advanced_producer\" }\n]\n```\n- Index = Rank (0 = 1st place, 1 = 2nd place, etc.)\n- Top 3 indices = Winners displayed on winners page\n- Constraint: Lower-tier submissions cannot rank above higher-tier submissions\n\n**Rating Tiers:**\n\n| Tier | Rating Range |\n|------|--------------|\n| Developing Skills | 1-2 |\n| Emerging Producer | 3-4 |\n| Proficient Creator | 5-6 |\n| Advanced Producer | 7-8 |\n| Master Creator | 9-10 |\n\n## Authentication & Security\n\n**Auth Flows by Role:**\n\n| Role | Method | Implementation |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| Super Admin | Email + Password | Supabase Auth standard login |\n| Judge | Email + Password | Supabase invite → set password on first visit |\n| Participant | Contest Code + Participant Code | Stateless, localStorage, no Supabase account |\n\n**Participant Session Security:**\n- Codes stored in localStorage with `last_activity` timestamp\n- Session expires after **120 minutes** of inactivity\n- Active upload keeps session alive\n- Logout button with reminder for shared devices\n\n**Bunny Upload Security (CRITICAL):**\n- No direct public Bunny endpoints\n- Signed upload URLs generated server-side via Edge Function\n- Validation before URL generation: valid codes, category open, within limits\n- Storage isolation: `/{contest_id}/{category_id}/{participant_code}/{file}`\n- Rate limiting per participant per contest\n\n## API Patterns\n\n| Operation | Approach | Reason |\n|-----------|----------|--------|\n| Read/write contests, categories, submissions | Supabase Client + RLS | Simple CRUD, RLS enforces access |\n| Generate Bunny signed URLs | Edge Function | Secret keys, validation logic |\n| Send email notifications | Edge Function | Brevo API keys, async |\n| Validate participant codes | Edge Function | Rate limiting, session token |\n\n**Row Level Security (RLS):**\n- Admin: Full access to all tables\n- Judge: Read assigned categories + submissions, write reviews/rankings\n- Participant (via Edge Function): Own submissions only\n\n## Frontend Architecture\n\n**State Management:**\n\n| State Type | Solution |\n|------------|----------|\n| Server state | TanStack Query |\n| UI state | React Context |\n| Form state | React Hook Form + Zod |\n\n**Folder Structure: Bulletproof React**\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── features/\n│   ├── auth/\n│   │   ├── api/\n│   │   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── types/\n│   │   └── index.ts          # REQUIRED\n│   ├── contests/\n│

} from './components/RatingScale';\nexport { useReviews, useSubmitReview } from './hooks/useReviews';\nexport { reviewsApi } from './api/reviewsApi';\nexport type { Review, Rating, Tier } from './types/review.types';\n```\n\n**Import Rule:**\n```typescript\n// ✅ Good\nimport { RatingScale, useReviews } from '@/features/reviews';\n\n// ❌ Bad\nimport { RatingScale } from '@/features/reviews/components/RatingScale';\n```\n\n**For AI Agents:** When exploring or modifying a feature:\n1. FIRST read `features/{feature}/index.ts`\n2. Understand available exports before diving into subfolders\n3. When adding new exports, UPDATE the index.ts\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n**Environments:**\n\n| Environment | Supabase Project | Purpose |\n|-------------|------------------|---------|\n| developme…1522 tokens truncated…ng | Separate data models for judge view vs admin view |\n| Security | Password-protected winners | Client-side gate, data fetched only after auth |\n| Scalability | 5+ concurrent contests | Multi-tenant data model, efficient queries |\n| Scalability | 200-500 participants/contest | Bunny handles storage scale, Supabase handles metadata |\n| Reliability | 99.5% upload success | Resumable uploads, retry logic, clear error states |\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\n\n- Primary domain: Full-stack web application (React SPA + Supabase BaaS)\n- Complexity level: Medium-High\n- Estimated architectural components: ~15-20 (auth, contests, categories, codes, submissions, reviews, rankings, notifications, file handling, etc.)\n\n## Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n**Fixed Technology Choices (from PRD):**\n- Frontend: React + Vite (SPA, no SSR needed)\n- Backend: Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL, Edge Functions if needed)\n- Video: Bunny Stream (storage, transcoding, streaming)\n- Photos/Assets: Bunny Storage (all files per architectural decision)\n- Email: Brevo (transactional templates)\n- Hosting: Vercel (frontend deployment)\n\n**Design System (from UX Spec):**\n- Component library: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS\n- Typography: Inter\n- Custom components: 7 identified (UploadProgress, RatingScale, MediaViewer, SubmissionCard, ContestCard, RankingDropzone, CodeListTable)\n\n## Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n1. **File Upload Pipeline**\n   - Direct browser → Bunny uploads (bypass server)\n   - Chunked/resumable for large videos\n   - Progress tracking with real-time UI feedback\n   - Timestamp locks on upload start (deadline fairness)\n\n2. **Role-Based Access Control**\n   - Admin: Full access to all data\n   - Judge: Anonymous view only (codes, no PII)\n   - Participant: Own submissions and feedback only\n   - Enforced at database level (RLS policies)\n\n3. **Contest State Machine**\n   - States: Draft → Published → Closed → Reviewed → Finished\n   - Categories have independent status within contests\n   - State transitions trigger notifications\n\n4. **Anonymous Data Isolation**\n   - Judge queries must never join to participant PII\n   - Separate API endpoints or views for judge vs admin\n   - Audit trail for any PII access\n\n5. **Notification System**\n   - Trigger points: Judge assignment, category close, review complete, contest finish\n   - Brevo templates for each notification type\n   - Async processing (don't block user actions)\n\n6. **Bunny Upload Security (CRITICAL)**\n   - **No direct public Bunny endpoints** — All uploads authenticated and authorized\n   - **Signed upload URLs** — Short-lived, single-use URLs generated server-side after validating:\n     - Valid participant code for the contest\n     - Category is still open (not past deadline)\n     - User hasn't exceeded submission limits\n   - **Storage isolation** — Unique paths: `/{contest_id}/{category_id}/{participant_code}/{file}`\n   - **No enumeration** — Participants cannot list or guess other file paths\n   - **Delete protection** — Only submitting participant (pre-deadline) or admin can delete\n   - **Rate limiting** — Per-participant, per-contest limits to prevent abuse\n   - **File validation** — Verify file type and size before accepting\n# Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n## Complete Project Directory Structure\n\n```\nmedia-education-solutions/\n├── PROJECT_INDEX.md                   #

Read `PROJECT_INDEX.md` at project root\n2. Understand all features, contexts, and edge functions that exist\n\n**Before modifying a feature:**\n1. Read `features/{feature}/index.ts` completely\n2. Understand all exports before making changes\n3. Check for related tests (co-located with source)\n\n**After adding new files:**\n1. Add export to the relevant `index.ts` immediately\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding new features, contexts, edge functions, or major components\n\n**After removing files:**\n1. Remove export from the relevant `index.ts`\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if removing features or major components\n\n**NEVER:**\n- Create files without adding to index\n- Delete files without removing from index\n- Import from deep paths (always use index exports)\n- Modify files without first reading the feature's index\n\n## Requirements to Structure Mapping\n\n| Feature Area | Primary Location | Related Files |\n|--------------|------------------|---------------|\n| FR1-FR5: Auth | `features/auth/` | `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` |\n| FR6-FR14: Contests | `features/contests/` | `pages/admin/ContestDetailPage.tsx` |\n| FR15-FR19: Participant Codes | `features/participants/` | `pages/admin/ParticipantCodesPage.tsx` |\n| FR20-FR24: Judge Management | `features/auth/`, `features/categories/` | `supabase/functions/send-notification/` |\n| FR25-FR37: Submissions | `features/submissions/` | `supabase/functions/generate-upload-url/` |\n| FR38-FR48: Judging | `features/reviews/`, `features/rankings/` | `pages/judge/ReviewPage.tsx` |\n| FR49-FR53: Admin Override | `features/reviews/`, `features/rankings/` | `pages/admin/SubmissionsPage.tsx` |\n| FR54-FR60: Winners | `features/rankings/` | `pages/public/WinnersPage.tsx` |\n| FR61-FR64: Notifications | `features/notifications/` | `supabase/functions/send-notification/` |\n\n## Architectural Boundaries\n\n**Import Rules:**\n\n| Layer | Can Import From | Cannot Import From |\n|-------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| `pages/` | `features/` (via index), `components/ui/`, `contexts/`, `lib/` | Other pages directly |\n| `features/*/components/` | `components/ui/`, own feature's hooks/types | Other features (use index) |\n| `features/*/hooks/` | Own feature's api/types, `lib/` | Components |\n| `components/ui/` | `lib/utils.ts` only | Features, pages, contexts |\n\n**Data Flow:**\n\n| Data Type | Managed By | Accessed Via |\n|-----------|------------|--------------|\n| Server data | TanStack Query | Feature hooks |\n| Auth state | AuthContext | `useAuth()` |\n| Participant session | ParticipantSessionContext | `useParticipantSession()` |\n| Form data | React Hook Form | Component-local |\n\n## External Integration Points\n\n| Service | Integration File | Purpose |\n|---------|------------------|---------|\n| Supabase Auth | `lib/supabase.ts`, `features/auth/` | Admin/Judge authentication |\n| Supabase DB | `lib/supabase.ts`, feature API files | All data operations |\n| Bunny Stream | `supabase/functions/generate-upload-url/` | Video upload URLs |\n| Bunny Storage | `supabase/functions/generate-upload-url/` | Photo upload URLs |\n| Brevo | `supabase/functions/send-notification/` | Email notifications |\n| Sentry | `lib/sentry.ts` | Error tracking |\n# Starter Template Evaluation\n\n## Primary Technology Domain\n\nFull-stack web application (React SPA + Supabase BaaS) based on project requirements analysis.\n\n## Selected Approach: Official Manual Setup\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Always up-to-date (Tailwind v4, React 19, Vite 6+)\n- No third-party template dependencies\n- You control exactly what's included\n- Official documentation matches your setup\n\n**Initialization Sequence:**\n\n```bash\n# 1.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

System Components (shadcn/ui)\n\n**Directly usable from shadcn/ui:**\n\n| Category | Components |\n|----------|------------|\n| **Forms** | Button, Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Form (with React Hook Form + Zod) |\n| **Layout** | Card, Dialog, Sheet, Tabs, Separator |\n| **Data Display** | Table, Badge, Progress, Avatar, Skeleton |\n| **Feedback** | Toast, Alert, Tooltip |\n| **Navigation** | Dropdown Menu, Navigation Menu |\n\nAll components used as-is with Untitled UI color tokens applied via Tailwind config.\n\n## Custom Components\n\n### `<UploadProgress>`\n**Purpose:** The defining upload experience for participants\n**Content:** File name, progress bar, percentage, upload speed, processing state\n**States:** Idle, Uploading, Processing, Complete, Error\n**Key Feature:** Smooth progress animation, clear error recovery\n\n### `<RatingScale>`\n**Purpose:** 5-tier judge rating selection\n**Content:** Five labeled tiers (Developing Skills → Master Creator) with numeric ranges\n**States:** Unselected, Hovered, Selected\n**Key Feature:** Visual feedback on selection, keyboard accessible\n\n### `<SubmissionCard>`\n**Purpose:** Anonymous submission display for judges\n**Content:** Participant code, media thumbnail, rating status, feedback preview\n**States:** Unreviewed, In Progress, Reviewed\n**Key Feature:** No PII visible — code only\n\n### `<MediaViewer>`\n**Purpose:** Full-screen photo/video display\n**Content:** Photo or video with playback controls\n**States:** Loading, Playing, Paused, Fullscreen, Error\n**Key Feature:** Esc to exit, Spacebar play/pause, arrow keys for next/prev\n\n### `<CodeListTable>`\n**Purpose:** Participant code management for admin\n**Content:** Code, status (Used/Unused), participant name if used\n**States:** Default, Filtered, Exporting\n**Key Feature:** Bulk export, status filtering\n\n### `<ContestCard>`\n**Purpose:** Dashboard overview card for each contest\n**Content:** Contest name, status badge, submission count, judge progress\n**States:** Draft, Published, Closed, Reviewed, Finished\n**Key Feature:** Answers \"how is this contest doing?\" at a glance\n\n### `<RankingDropzone>`\n**Purpose:** Drag-and-drop top 3 ranking for judges\n**Content:** Three numbered positions with submission cards\n**States:** Empty, Partially filled, Complete\n**Key Feature:** Drag to reorder, visual feedback on drop\n\n## Component Implementation Strategy\n\n**Build Order (by user journey criticality):**\n\n| Priority | Component | Needed For |\n|----------|-----------|------------|\n| P0 | `<UploadProgress>` | Participant upload (defining experience) |\n| P0 | `<RatingScale>` | Judge review flow |\n| P0 | `<MediaViewer>` | Judge review flow |\n| P1 | `<SubmissionCard>` | Judge review flow |\n| P1 | `<ContestCard>` | Admin dashboard |\n| P1 | `<RankingDropzone>` | Judge ranking |\n| P2 | `<CodeListTable>` | Admin code management |\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\n- Build on top of shadcn/ui primitives where possible\n- Use Tailwind for styling consistency\n- Follow component library discipline (all variants in one file)\n# Core User Experience\n\n## Defining Experience\n\nThe platform serves three distinct user types with fundamentally different core actions:\n\n| Role | Primary Action | Frequency |\n|------|---------------|-----------|\n| **Super Admin (Jeb)** | Creating/editing contests + monitoring progress + overriding judges | Daily during active contests |\n| **Judges** | Rating submissions + writing feedback + ranking top 3 | Session-based (45-min blocks) |\n| **Participants** | Uploading creative work + confirming submission | One-time per category (with possible edits) |\n\nThe platform must excel at all three, but **Judge review flow** is the make-or-break interaction — frustrated judges create support burden for Jeb, undermining the platform's core value proposition.\n\n## Platform Strategy\n\n**Primary:** Desktop/laptop (all user types)\n**Secondary:** Mobile responsive (same interface, fluid adaptation)\n\n- No separate mobile-specific interfaces or touch-optimized variants\n- Responsive design ensures usability across screen sizes\n- Participants may occasionally submit from mobile (CapCut editors, etc.)\n- Judges may review on-the-go in limited scenarios\n- Admin workflows assume full keyboard/mouse environment\n\n## Effortless Interactions\n\n| Role | Effortless Moment | Design Implication |\n|------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **Jeb** | \"How is this contest doing?\" | Dashboard answers in one glance — no clicks required |\n| **Judges** | \"What do I review next?\" | Obvious next action, never ambiguous |\n| **Participants** | \"Did my upload work?\" | Unmistakable confirmation, no uncertainty |\n\n## Critical Success Moments\n\n1. **Upload Completion** — Sofia at 11:51 PM must feel absolute certainty her submission succeeded\n2. **Judge First Session** — Marcus's first 10 minutes determine if he'll finish or abandon\n3. **Contest Launch** — Jeb publishing a contest and seeing codes generate instantly\n4. **Deadline Crunch** — 100+ simultaneous uploads completing without failure\n\n## Experience Principles\n\n1. **Clarity Over Cleverness** — Every screen answers \"what do I do here?\" in under 3 seconds\n2. **Confidence at Every Step** — Users always know: Did it work? What's next? Am I done?\n3. **Desktop-First, Responsive Always** — Optimize for laptop workflows, never break on mobile\n4. **Reliability is UX** — Technical performance IS the user experience\n5. **Role-Appropriate Density** — Same design system, right information density per context\n# Defining Experience\n\n## The Core Moment\n\n**\"Upload and be certain\"**\n\nThe participant upload experience is the defining interaction for Media Education Solutions. This is the highest-stakes moment — Sofia at 11:59 PM, racing the deadline, needing absolute confidence that her work is safe.\n\nIf we nail this moment, everything else follows:\n- Participants trust the platform\n- Jeb doesn't get \"did my upload work?\" emails\n- The product earns word-of-mouth recommendations\n\n## User Mental Model\n\n**What participants expect:**\n- Progress that feels real (not fake progress bars)\n- Clear feedback at every stage\n- Ability to preview before final submit\n- Unmistakable confirmation when done\n- Graceful handling if something goes wrong\n\n**Current frustrations with uploads:**\n- Vague progress indicators\n- No idea if it's working or frozen\n- Unclear error messages when something fails\n- Anxiety about whether it actually went through\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n| Criteria | Target |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Confidence** | User never wonders \"is it working?\" |\n| **Progress clarity** | Percentage + speed + time remaining visible |\n| **Deadline fairness** | Timestamp captured at upload START, not completion |\n| **Completion certainty** | Unmistakable confirmation with timestamp |\n| **Verification** | Preview before final submit |\n\n## Submission Timestamp Logic (CRITICAL)\n\nTo protect participants with slow connections during deadline crunch:\n\n| Event | Timestamp Behavior |\n|-------|-------------------|\n| Upload starts at 11:59 PM | Timestamp **locks** at 11:59 PM |\n| Upload completes at 12:03 AM | Grace period begins (10-15 minutes) |\n| Submit clicked within grace period | Submission time = **11:59 PM** (protected) |\n| Submit clicked after grace period expires | Submission time = **actual click time** (late) |\n\n**UX Implications:**\n- Show locked timestamp prominently during upload: \"Your submission time: 11:59 PM\"\n- After upload completes, show countdown: \"Submit within 14:32 to keep your 11:59 PM timestamp\"\n- If grace period expires, update messaging: \"Your submission time will be when you click Submit\"\n\n## Experience Mechanics\n\n**Stage 1: Initiation**\n- Generous drag-and-drop zone (not a tiny button)\n- File specs visible: \"Up to 500MB • MP4, MOV, WebM\"\n- Instant validation before upload begins (format, size)\n- Click-to-browse as fallback\n\n**Stage 2: Upload Progress**\n- **Timestamp locks when upload starts** — display prominently\n- Smooth progress bar (no jumps or freezes)\n- Real metrics: \"67% • 2.3 MB/s • ~45 seconds remaining\"\n- Connection quality indicator\n- Cancel option always visible\n\n**Stage 3: Processing**\n- \"Processing video...\" state after upload completes\n- Explain what's happening: \"Preparing your video for playback...\"\n- Show processing progress if available from Bunny\n- Grace period countdown begins\n\n**Stage 4: Preview**\n- Thumbnail generated and displayed\n- Play button to verify correct file\n- File details visible (duration, size)\n- Grace period countdown visible: \"Submit within 12:45 to lock your 11:59 PM time\"\n\n**Stage 5: Confirmation**\n- Big submit button: \"Submit to [Category Name]\"\n- Post-submit confirmation screen:\n  - Green checkmark, unmistakable success\n  - \"Submitted at 11:59 PM — before the 12:00 AM deadline\"\n  - Submission reference code\n  - \"You can edit until [deadline]\" if applicable\n  - Screenshot-worthy for Sofia to send to her coach\n\n**Error Handling**\n- Connection slow: \"Upload continuing... connection is slow but stable\"\n- Connection lost: \"Connection interrupted. [Try again]\" (resumable upload if Bunny supports it — verify during implementation)\n- File rejected: Specific reason + what to do (\"File is 520MB. Maximum is 500MB. [Choose different file]\")\n- Server error: \"Something went wrong on our end. [Try again] — your file is safe locally\"\n\n## Pattern Classification\n\n**Established patterns we're using:**\n- Drag-and-drop upload (Dropbox, Google Drive)\n- Progress bar with real metrics (WeTransfer)\n- Preview before submit (YouTube)\n- Confirmation with timestamp (form submissions)\n\n**Our refinements:**\n- Timestamp locks at upload START (deadline fairness)\n- Grace period with visible countdown\n- \"Deadline-aware\" messaging throughout\n- Screenshot-worthy confirmation (Sofia texts her coach)\n\n**Implementation Notes:**\n- Resumable uploads: Verify if Bunny supports this; if not, design graceful retry\n- Grace period duration: Recommend 10-15 minutes, confirm with Jeb\n# Design Direction Decision\n\n## Chosen Direction\n\n**Premium European Design** — A singular, cohesive direction established through collaborative discovery.\n\n| Element | Decision |\n|---------|----------|\n| **Aesthetic** | Scandinavian/Swiss restraint — every element earns its place |\n| **Color System** | Untitled UI palette |\n| **Typography** | Inter |\n| **Components** | shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS |\n| **Inspiration** | Linear, Untitled UI, Stripe |\n| **Mode** | Light only |\n| **Density** | Role-based (dense for Admin, spacious for Judges/Participants) |\n\n## Design Rationale\n\nNo exploratory mockups were needed — the design direction emerged clearly through our conversation:\n\n1. **Inspiration alignment** — Linear, Untitled UI, and Stripe share a common visual language that maps directly to implementation via shadcn/ui\n2. **Technical consistency** — shadcn/ui + Tailwind provides the exact aesthetic without custom design work\n3. **User-appropriate density** — Role-based spacing addresses the distinct needs of power users (Jeb) vs. occasional users (Judges, Participants)\n4. **Simplicity** — Light mode only reduces complexity and maintenance burden\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nThe design direction is immediately implementable:\n- Install shadcn/ui components into the React + Vite project\n- Configure Tailwind with Untitled UI color tokens\n- Apply Inter typeface via Google Fonts or local hosting\n- Follow component library discipline (all UI from shared components)\n\nNo custom design tokens or component variants needed beyond what shadcn/ui provides.\n# Design Direction\n\n**Inspiration:** Linear, shadcn/ui, Untitled UI, Stripe\n\n**Aesthetic:** Modern, sleek, minimal. Clean typography, generous whitespace, subtle animations that feel purposeful rather than decorative. Dark mode consideration. Professional polish that builds trust.\n\n---\n# Design System Foundation\n\n## Design System Choice\n\n**Primary:** shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS\n**Typography:** Inter\n**Mode:** Light only\n\nThis combination provides:\n- Linear/Untitled UI/Stripe-level polish out of the box\n- Full ownership of component code (copy into project, not npm dependency)\n- Tailwind's utility-first approach for consistent spacing and styling\n- Accessible, keyboard-navigable components by default\n\n## Rationale for Selection\n\n| Requirement | How shadcn/ui + Tailwind Delivers |\n|-------------|----------------------------------|\n| Modern, sleek aesthetic | Matches Linear/Untitled UI visual language exactly |\n| Inter typeface | Default font, no configuration needed |\n| Component consistency | Pre-built, tested components with unified API |\n| React + Vite stack | Native integration, no adapters needed |\n| Customization control | Own the code, modify freely, no vendor lock-in |\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n**Component Library Discipline (CRITICAL)**\n\nEvery UI element MUST use shared components from the design system. No exceptions.\n\n| Rule | Rationale |\n|------|-----------|\n| All buttons use `<Button>` component | Update once, propagate everywhere |\n| All inputs use `<Input>` component | Consistent validation, focus states, sizing |\n| All cards use `<Card>` component | Unified shadows, borders, padding |\n| No inline Tailwind for component-level styling | Prevents visual drift and inconsistency |\n| New patterns go into component library first | Then used across the app |\n\n**Folder Structure:**\n```\nsrc/\n  components/\n    ui/           # shadcn/ui base components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)\n    composed/     # App-specific composed components (SubmissionCard, RatingScale, etc.)\n```\n\n**Enforcement:**\n- Code reviews must verify component library usage\n- No raw `<button>` or `<input>` elements in feature code\n- Tailwind utilities allowed for layout (flex, grid, spacing) but not for component styling\n\n## Customization Strategy\n\n**Design Tokens (via Tailwind config):**\n- Colors: Primary, secondary, success, warning, error, neutral scale\n- Spacing: Consistent 4px base unit\n- Border radius: Subtle, consist…1884 tokens truncated… (< lg) |\n|-----------|---------------|---------------|\n| Admin sidebar | Fixed 256px | Hamburger menu / sheet |\n| Tables | Full columns | Horizontal scroll or card view |\n| Forms | Max-width 600px | Full width, stacked |\n| Media viewer | Fullscreen overlay | Fullscreen native |\n| Buttons | Inline grouping | Full width, stacked |\n\n## Accessibility Strategy\n\n**Target:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA\n\n| Requirement | Implementation |\n|-------------|---------------|\n| **Color contrast** | 4.5:1 minimum (body text), 3:1 (large text) |\n| **Keyboard navigation** | All interactive elements focusable, logical tab order |\n| **Focus indicators** | Visible focus ring on all interactive elements |\n| **Screen readers** | Semantic HTML, ARIA labels where needed |\n| **Touch targets** | Minimum 44x44px |\n| **Reduced motion** | Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` |\n| **Text resizing** | Usable up to 200% zoom |\n\n**Role-Specific Considerations:**\n\n| User | Accessibility Notes |\n|------|---------------------|\n| Jeb (Admin) | Power user, keyboard proficient — ensure shortcuts work |\n| Judges | Potentially older users — ensure good contrast, readable text |\n| Participants | Teens with varying abilities — ensure upload flow is screen-reader friendly |\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n**Responsive Testing:**\n- Chrome DevTools device simulation for layout verification\n- Real device testing: iPhone, Android phone, iPad\n- **MacBook Pro 13\" (1440px) as primary QA device**\n- Browser testing: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge\n\n**Accessibility Testing:**\n- Automated: axe DevTools, Lighthouse accessibility audit\n- Manual: Keyboard-only navigation testing\n- Screen reader: VoiceOver (Mac/iOS), NVDA (Windows)\n- Color: Contrast checker, colorblind simulation\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- Lighthouse accessibility score ≥ 90\n- Zero critical axe violations\n- Complete keyboard navigation possible\n- All form fields have associated labels\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n**Responsive Development:**\n- Use Tailwind responsive prefixes consistently\n- Mobile styles as default, enhance with `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`\n- Use `rem` and `%` over fixed `px` where appropriate\n- Test touch targets on actual devices\n- Ensure forms are usable on mobile keyboards\n\n**Accessibility Development:**\n- Semantic HTML: `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<button>`\n- Headings: Logical hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3), never skip levels\n- Images: Alt text for informational images, empty alt for decorative\n- Forms: `<label>` associated with every input, error messages linked via `aria-describedby`\n- Focus: Never remove focus outlines, customize with visible styles\n- Dynamic content: `aria-live` regions for toasts and status updates\n\n---\n\n*UX Design Specification Complete — 2026-01-09*\n# User Journey Flows\n\n## Flow 1: Participant Upload (Sofia at 11:51 PM)\n\n**Goal:** Submit creative work before deadline with absolute confidence\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Enter Contest Code + Participant Code] --> B{Valid codes?}\n    B -->|No| A\n    B -->|Yes| C[View Contest & Categories]\n    C --> D[Select

visible (\"8 of 18 reviewed\")\n- One submission at a time (focused, not overwhelming)\n- Arrow keys for quick navigation\n- Satisfying completion state\n\n---\n\n## Flow 3: Admin Contest Creation (Jeb Setting Up)\n\n**Goal:** Create fully-configured contest efficiently\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Dashboard: Click New Contest] --> B[Enter Contest Details]\n    B --> C[Name, Description, Contest Code, Rules]\n    C --> D[Add Categories]\n    D --> E[Category: Name, Type Photo/Video, Deadline, Rules]\n    E --> F{More categories?}\n    F -->|Yes| D\n    F -->|No| G[Assign Judges to

P --> Q[View/Export Code List]\n```\n\n**Key UX Moments:**\n- Clear step progression\n- Auto-generate 50 codes on publish\n- Can save draft and return\n- Immediate confirmation with code list\n\n---\n\n## Flow 4: Admin Dashboard (Jeb Checking Status)\n\n**Goal:** Answer \"How are my contests doing?\" in one glance\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Login] --> B[Dashboard: All Contests Overview]\n    B --> C{What to check?}\n    C -->|Contest Status| D[Contest Cards with Status Badges]\n    D --> E[See: Draft/Published/Closed/Reviewed/Finished]\n    C -->|Submissions| F[Submission

Moments:**\n- Dashboard answers questions without clicking\n- Status badges immediately scannable\n- Progress bars show judge status at a glance\n- Drill-down for actions, not just viewing\n\n---\n\n## Journey Patterns\n\n**Common patterns across all flows:**\n\n| Pattern | Implementation |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Entry clarity** | Every flow starts with obvious entry point and clear first action |\n| **Progress visibility** | Users always know where they are and what's left |\n| **Confirmation explicitness** | Actions that matter get explicit confirmation (\"Submitted at 11:51 PM\") |\n| **Error recovery** | Every failure state has a clear recovery path |\n| **Exit clarity** | Users know when they're done and what happens next |\n\n## Flow Optimization Principles\n\n1. **Minimize clicks to value** — Sofia uploads in 4 steps, not 10\n2. **Show don't tell** — Progress bars over text descriptions\n3. **Smart defaults** — Auto-fill participant info, auto-generate codes\n4. **Contextual actions** — Show only relevant actions for current state\n5. **Batch operations** — Jeb generates 50 codes at once, not one by one\n# UX Consistency Patterns\n\n## Button Hierarchy\n\n| Level | Style | Usage |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| **Primary** | Solid, brand color | One per screen — the main action (Submit, Publish, Save) |\n| **Secondary** | Outlined | Alternative actions (Cancel, Back, Save Draft) |\n| **Ghost** | Text only | Tertiary actions (Learn more, View details) |\n| **Destructive** | Red solid | Dangerous actions (Delete, Remove) — always with confirmation |\n\n**Rules:**\n- Never more than one Primary button visible at a time\n- Destructive actions require confirmation dialog\n- Button text uses verbs: \"Submit Entry\" not \"Submission\"\n\n## Feedback Patterns\n\n| Type | Style | Duration | Usage |\n|------|-------|----------|-------|\n| **Success** | Green toast, top-right | 4 seconds | Confirmations: \"Contest published\", \"Rating saved\" |\n| **Error** | Red toast, top-right | Until dismissed | Failures: \"Upload failed\", \"Connection lost\" |\n| **Warning** | Amber inline | Persistent | Deadlines: \"Deadline in 2 hours\" |\n| **Info** | Blue inline | Persistent | Guidance: \"Judges will see anonymous codes only\" |\n\n**Rules:**\n- Success toasts auto-dismiss\n- Error toasts require user dismissal (with clear action)\n- Never stack more than 2 toasts\n- Inline messages for contextual warnings (near the relevant element)\n\n## Form Patterns\n\n**Validation:**\n- Validate on blur (not on every keystroke)\n- Show errors inline below the field\n- Green checkmark for valid fields (optional, not required)\n- Error messages are specific: \"File must be under 500MB\" not \"Invalid file\"\n\n**Layout:**\n- Single column forms (no side-by-side fields except related pairs like city/state)\n- Labels above inputs (not inline)\n- Required fields marked with subtle asterisk\n- Submit button at bottom, full width on mobile\n\n**Auto-save:**\n- Admin forms auto-save drafts\n- Participant uploads do NOT auto-submit (explicit action required)\n\n## Navigation Patterns\n\n**Admin (Jeb):**\n- Sidebar navigation (256px, collapsible on mobile)\n- Breadcrumbs for deep navigation (Contest > Category > Submission)\n- Tabs for related views (Contest Details, Codes, Judges, Submissions)\n\n**Judge (Marcus):**\n- Minimal navigation — focus on the task\n- Progress indicator always visible\n- Back/Next for sequential review\n- No sidebar (distraction-free)\n\n**Participant (Sofia):**\n- Step indicator for multi-step flow\n- Clear \"back\" option without losing progress\n- No navigation menu (single-purpose flow)\n\n## Empty States\n\n| Context | Message | Action |\n|---------|---------|--------|\n| No contests | \"No contests yet\" | \"Create your first contest\" button |\n| No submissions | \"No submissions in this category\" | Show deadline reminder |\n| No assigned reviews | \"All caught up!\" | Celebrate completion |\n| No codes generated | \"Codes generate when you publish\" | Explain next step |\n\n**Rules:**\n- Empty states always explain why it's empty\n- Include a primary action when applicable\n- Use illustrations sparingly (only if brand includes them)\n\n## Loading States\n\n| Context | Pattern |\n|---------|---------|\n| Page load | Skeleton (content shapes) |\n| Button action | Spinner inside button, button disabled |\n| Upload | Progress bar with percentage |\n| Data fetch | Skeleton for content area only |\n\n**Rules:**\n- Skeletons for content (tables, cards, text)\n- Spinners for actions (buttons, submissions)\n- Never block the entire screen unless absolutely necessary\n- Show progress for anything > 2 seconds\n\n## Status Badge Patterns\n\n| Status | Color | Context |\n|--------|-------|---------|\n| Draft | Gray | Contest not yet published |\n| Published | Blue | Contest accepting submissions |\n| Closed | Amber | Submissions closed, judging active |\n| Reviewed | Purple | Judging complete, pending finalization |\n| Finished | Green | Results published |\n| Used | Gray | Participant code has been used |\n| Unused | Subtle border only | Participant code available |\n\n**Rules:**\n- Badges include text label (not color alone)\n- Consistent across all contexts (cards, tables, details)\n# UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n## Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n| Product | Core Strength | Key Lesson for Media Education Solutions |\n|---------|---------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Linear** | Minimal chrome, subtle gradients, typography that breathes | Information density without clutter — Jeb's dashboard can be data-rich without feeling overwhelming |\n| **shadcn/ui** | Component consistency, accessible defaults, \"copy and own\" philosophy | Sensible defaults — every button, input, card works beautifully without heavy customization |\n| **Untitled UI** | Enterprise polish with startup aesthetics, clean data tables, scalable tokens | Dashboard patterns — lots of information, zero confusion; perfect for contest monitoring |\n| **Stripe** | \"Feels expensive\" quality, intentional micro-interactions, helpful error states | Trust through polish — every detail signals competence; critical for upload confidence |\n\n## Transferable UX Patterns\n\n**Navigation & Layout (from Linear + Untitled UI)**\n- Sidebar navigation with clear hierarchy\n- Contextual headers that tell you where you are\n- Generous whitespace that lets content breathe\n- Subtle borders and shadows, never heavy dividers\n\n**Components & Interactions (from shadcn/ui + Stripe)**\n- Consistent button hierarchy (primary/secondary/ghost)\n- Form inputs with clear focus states and inline validation\n- Cards with subtle hover states\n- Toast notifications for confirmations and errors\n\n**Data Display (from Linear + Untitled UI)**\n- Tables that scale gracefully with data volume\n- Progress indicators that feel satisfying to watch\n- Status badges with semantic colors (not just red/green)\n- Metric cards that answer questions at a glance\n\n**Feedback & Confirmation (from Stripe)**\n- Micro-animations on state changes (not decorative, functional)\n- Explicit success states (\"Saved\" not just removing a spinner)\n- Error messages with context and recovery actions\n- Loading states that indicate progress, not just \"working...\"\n\n## Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Our Alternative |\n|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| **Modal overload** | Interrupts flow, feels like being trapped | Inline editing, slide-overs for complex forms |\n| **Vague confirmations** | \"Success!\" means nothing | Specific: \"Contest published. 50 codes generated.\" |\n| **Hidden actions** | Three-dot menus for primary actions | Primary actions visible, secondary in menus |\n| **Skeleton overuse** | Can feel slower than spinners for quick loads | Skeletons for content, spinners for actions |\n| **Aggressive validation** | Yelling at users before they finish typing | Validate on blur, show errors gently |\n| **Dark mode complexity** | Toggle adds maintenance burden, edge cases | Light mode only — clean, consistent, maintainable |\n| **Keyboard shortcut overload** | Power-user features that most users ignore | Minimal shortcuts for genuinely useful actions only |\n\n## Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**Adopt Directly:**\n- Untitled UI's Inter typeface and typography scale\n- shadcn/ui component patterns (buttons, inputs, cards, tables)\n- Stripe's error state copywriting approach\n- Untitled UI's dashboard card patterns\n- Linear's whitespace philosophy\n\n**Adapt for Our Context:**\n- Linear's information density — simplify for Judge's \"one thing at a time\" need\n- Stripe's polish level — maintain for critical paths (upload, submission), lighter touch elsewhere\n- Untitled UI's data tables — streamline for our specific contest/category/submission hierarchy\n\n**Explicit Constraints:**\n- Light mode only (no dark mode, no toggle)\n- Inter typeface throughout\n- Minimal keyboard shortcuts:\n  - **Esc** — exit fullscreen view\n  - **Spacebar** — play/pause video\n  - **← →** — previous/next submission (Judge review only)\n# Visual Design Foundation\n\n## Design Aesthetic\n\n**Premium European Design Language**\n\nThe visual identity draws from Scandinavian/Swiss design principles:\n- Restraint as luxury — every element earns its place\n- Whitespace as a design element, not empty space\n- Typography-forward hierarchy\n- Color used sparingly and purposefully\n- Quiet confidence over flashy decoration\n\n## Color System\n\n**Foundation:** Untitled UI color palette\n\n**Neutral Scale (Primary UI Colors):**\n| Token | Usage |\n|-------|-------|\n| Gray-50 | Page backgrounds |\n| Gray-100 | Card backgrounds, subtle borders |\n| Gray-200 | Dividers, disabled states |\n| Gray-300 | Borders |\n| Gray-400 | Placeholder text |\n| Gray-500 | Secondary text |\n| Gray-600 | Body text |\n| Gray-700 | Headings |\n| Gray-900 | Primary text, high contrast |\n\n**Brand/Primary Color:**\n- Untitled UI primary (clean blue or neutral accent)\n- Used sparingly: primary buttons, active states, key actions\n- Not splashed everywhere — reserved for what matters\n\n**Semantic Colors:**\n| Token | Color | Usage |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| Success | Green | Confirmations, completed states, \"Submitted successfully\" |\n| Warning | Amber | Deadlines approaching, grace period countdown |\n| Error | Red | Failed uploads, validation errors |\n| Info | Blue | Informational messages, tips |\n\n**Status Badge Colors (Contest/Submission States):**\n| Status | Color Treatment |\n|--------|----------------|\n| Draft | Gray, muted |\n| Published | Blue, active |\n| Closed | Amber, attention |\n| Reviewed | Purple, progress |\n| Finished | Green, complete |\n\n## Typography System\n\n**Typeface:** Inter\n\n**Type Scale:**\n| Level | Size | Weight | Usage |\n|-------|------|--------|-------|\n| Display | 36-48px | 600 | Hero headings (rare) |\n| H1 | 30px | 600 | Page titles |\n| H2 | 24px | 600 | Section headings |\n| H3 | 20px | 500 | Card titles, subsections |\n| H4 | 16px | 500 | Labels, small headings |\n| Body | 16px | 400 | Primary content |\n| Body Small | 14px | 400 | Secondary content, metadata |\n| Caption | 12px | 400 | Timestamps, hints, labels |\n\n**Line Heights:**\n- Headings: 1.2-1.3 (tight)\n- Body: 1.5-1.6 (comfortable reading)\n\n**Letter Spacing:**\n- Headings: -0.02em (slightly tighter)\n- Body: Normal\n- All caps labels: +0.05em (slightly looser)\n\n## Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n**Base Unit:** 4px (Tailwind default)\n\n**Spacing Scale:**\n| Token | Value | Usage |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| xs | 4px | Tight element spacing |\n| sm | 8px | Related element groups |\n| md | 16px | Component internal padding |\n| lg | 24px | Section spacing |\n| xl | 32px | Major section breaks |\n| 2xl | 48px | Page section separation |\n\n**Role-Based Density:**\n\n| Role | Density | Rationale |\n|------|---------|-----------|\n| **Admin (Jeb)** | Higher density | Needs to scan lots of data quickly; comfortable with information-rich views |\n| **Judges** | Medium-low density | Focus on one submission at a time; reduce cognitive load |\n| **Participants** | Low density | Generous spacing builds confidence; reduces anxiety during upload |\n\n**Layout Principles:**\n- Max content width: 1280px (centered on large screens)\n- Sidebar navigation: 256px fixed width\n- Card padding: 24px standard\n- Form field spacing: 16px between fields\n- Button spacing: 12px between grouped buttons\n\n## Accessibility Considerations\n\n**Contrast Ratios:**\n- Body text on backgrounds: Minimum 4.5:1 (WCAG AA)\n- Large text (18px+): Minimum 3:1\n- Interactive elements: Clear focus states with visible outlines\n\n**Touch Targets:**\n- Minimum 44x44px for interactive elements\n- Generous click/tap areas on mobile\n\n**Color Independence:**\n- Never rely on color alone to convey meaning\n- Status badges include text labels, not just color\n- Error states include icons + text, not just red color\n\n**Reduced Motion:**\n- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` system setting\n- Animations are subtle and purposeful, not decorative\n- No auto-playing animations or videos\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read this FIRST before any implementation work._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n| Category | Technology | Version |\n|----------|------------|---------|\n| Framework | React | 19 |\n| Build | Vite | 6+ |\n| Language | TypeScript | Strict mode |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS | v4 |\n| Components | shadcn/ui | Latest |\n| Backend | Supabase | Auth + PostgreSQL + Edge Functions |\n| Server State | TanStack Query | Latest |\n| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod | Latest |\n| Routing | React Router DOM | v6+ |\n| Monitoring | Sentry | Latest |\n\n**External Services:**\n- Bunny Stream (video storage/streaming)\n- Bunny Storage (photos/assets)\n- Brevo (transactional email)\n\n---\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Feature Architecture (MOST IMPORTANT)\n\n**Mandatory Index Files:**\n```typescript\n// Every feature folder MUST have index.ts exporting ALL contents\n// features/submissions/index.ts\n\n// === Components ===\nexport { UploadProgress } from './components/UploadProgress';\nexport { SubmissionCard } from './components/SubmissionCard';\n\n// === Hooks ===\nexport { useSubmissions } from './hooks/useSubmissions';\n\n// === API ===\nexport { submissionsApi } from './api/submissionsApi';\n\n// === Types ===\nexport type { Submission, SubmissionStatus } from './types/submission.types';\n```\n\n**Import Rules:**\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Always import from feature index\nimport { UploadProgress, useSubmissions } from '@/features/submissions';\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Never import from deep paths\nimport { UploadProgress } from '@/features/submissions/components/UploadProgress';\n```\n\n**After Creating Any New File:**\n1. Add export to the feature's `index.ts` immediately\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding new features or major components\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\n| Context | Convention | Example |\n|---------|------------|---------|\n| Database tables | snake_case, plural | `participants`, `contest_codes` |\n| Database columns | snake_case | `created_at`, `contest_id` |\n| TypeScript files | PascalCase (components), camelCase (utils) | `RatingScale.tsx`, `submissionsApi.ts` |\n| Functions/variables | camelCase | `getContests`, `isLoading` |\n| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE | `MAX_FILE_SIZE` |\n| Types/Interfaces | PascalCase | `Contest`, `SubmissionStatus` |\n| Hooks | use + PascalCase | `useContests`, `useFileUpload` |\n\n**Data Transformation:**\n- Database returns `snake_case` → Transform to `camelCase` in API layer\n- Never mix conventions within same layer\n\n### State Management Rules\n\n| State Type | Solution | Location |\n|------------|----------|----------|\n| Server data | TanStack Query | Feature hooks |\n| Form data | React Hook Form | Component-local |\n| Auth state | React Context | `AuthContext` |\n| Participant session | React Context | `ParticipantSessionContext` |\n| Local UI | useState | Component-local |\n\n**Never:**\n- Use useState for server data (use TanStack Query)\n- Create global state for form data\n- Mix state management solutions for same concern\n\n### Authentication Rules\n\n**Three Separate Auth Flows:**\n\n| Role | Method | Implementation |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| Admin | Email + Password | Supabase Auth |\n| Judge | Email + Password | Supabase Auth (invite flow) |\n| Participant | Contest Code + Participant Code | localStorage (NO Supabase account) |\n\n**Participant Session:**\n- Store codes in localStorage with `last_activity` timestamp\n- Expire after **120 minutes** of inactivity\n- Active upload keeps session alive\n- Clear on logout (shared device reminder)\n\n### Bunny Upload Security (CRITICAL)\n\n**Never expose Bunny credentials to client.**\n\n**Upload Flow:**\n1. Client requests signed URL from Edge Function\n2. Edge Function validates: participant codes, category open, within limits\n3. Edge Function returns short-lived signed URL\n4. Client uploads directly to Bunny using signed URL\n\n**Storage Path Pattern:**\n```\n/{contest_id}/{category_id}/{participant_code}/{filename}\n```\n\n### Anonymous Judging Rules\n\n**Judge queries must NEVER access participant PII.**\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Judge view query\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('id, media_url, participant_id')  // participant_id is UUID, not PII\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Joins to participant data\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('*, participants(name, organization)')  // EXPOSES PII\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\n**Use Standardized Error Codes:**\n```typescript\nimport { ERROR_CODES } from '@/lib/errorCodes';\n\n// Always use predefined codes\nthrow new AppError(ERROR_CODES.CATEGORY_CLOSED, 'Category deadline has passed');\n```\n\n**Error Codes Available:**\n- `INVALID_CODES`, `SESSION_EXPIRED`, `CONTEST_NOT_FOUND`\n- `CATEGORY_CLOSED`, `SUBMISSION_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`\n- `FILE_TOO_LARGE`, `INVALID_FILE_TYPE`\n- `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `SERVER_ERROR`\n\n### Component Structure\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Imports (React first, then external, then internal)\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui';\nimport { useContests } from '@/features/contests';\n\n// 2. Types (interface for props)\ninterface ContestCardProps {\n  contest: Contest;\n  onSelect: (id: string) => void;\n}\n\n// 3. Component (named export, not default)\nexport function ContestCard({ contest, onSelect }: ContestCardProps) {\n  // hooks first\n  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);\n\n  // handlers\n  const handleClick = () => onSelect(contest.id);\n\n  // render\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n**Co-locate tests with source:**\n```\nfeatures/submissions/components/\n├── UploadProgress.tsx\n├── UploadProgress.test.tsx  ← Same folder\n```\n\n**Test Naming:**\n- Unit tests: `{ComponentName}.test.tsx`\n- Integration tests: `{feature}.integration.test.ts`\n\n### Zod Schema Rules\n\n**Single Source of Truth:**\n```typescript\n// Define schema in types/ folder\n// features/contests/types/contest.schemas.ts\nexport const contestFormSchema = z.object({\n  name: z.string().min(1, 'Required'),\n  contestCode: z.string().length(6, 'Must be 6 digits'),\n});\n\n// Use in form AND API validation\n```\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)\n\n1. **Never import from deep paths** — Always use feature index\n2. **Never use useState for server data** — Use TanStack Query\n3. **Never expose Bunny credentials to client** — Use Edge Functions\n4. **Never join participant PII in judge queries** — Anonymous judging\n5. **Never skip index.ts updates** — Every export must be indexed\n6. **Never mix naming conventions** — snake_case DB, camelCase code\n7. **Never store participant passwords** — Code-only access\n8. **Never use default exports** — Named exports only\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n**Before implementing any feature:**\n1. Read `PROJECT_INDEX.md` at project root\n2. Read the feature's `index.ts` to understand existing exports\n3. Check architecture.md for patterns\n\n**After implementing:**\n1. Update feature's `index.ts` with new exports\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding major components\n3. Run type-check and lint before committing\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\n---\n\n_Last Updated: 2026-01-10_\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
