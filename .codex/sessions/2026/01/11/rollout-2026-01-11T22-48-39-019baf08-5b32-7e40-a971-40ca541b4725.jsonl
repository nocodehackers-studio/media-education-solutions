Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

[src/App.tsx:1]\n  - **Resolution:** DUPLICATE of item below. RouterProvider with createBrowserRouter is the correct modern React Router v6.4+ data router pattern. See router/index.tsx:1.\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] tw-animate-css import without dependency in package.json. [src/index.css:4]\n  - **Resolution:** DUPLICATE of item below. tailwindcss-animate is installed (package.json:35). The @plugin + @import syntax is correct for Tailwind v4.\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] shadcn/ui design tokens not configured in Tailwind theme. [tailwind.config.ts:3]\n  - **Resolution:** FALSE POSITIVE. shadcn/ui design tokens ARE configured in src/index.css using Tailwind v4's `@theme inline` block (lines 8-47) and CSS variables (lines 49-116). This is the correct Tailwind v4 pattern - tokens go in CSS, not tailwind.config.ts.\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Story File List claims app files created, but git shows only _bmad changes. [git status]\n  - **Resolution:** DUPLICATE of item below. Project files are untracked (new additions), not modified. Git shows _bmad as modified because those are existing files that were changed.\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] No test script or tests to validate AC1/AC4. [package.json:6]\n  - **Resolution:** OUT OF SCOPE. Dev Notes explicitly state: \"Tests will be co-located with source files (added in later stories)\". Story 1.1 focuses on project initialization; test framework setup is planned for a subsequent story.\n- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Task 1.4 marked done but App heading missing. [src/App.tsx:1]\n  - **Resolution:** Heading \"Media Education Solutions\" exists in HomePage component at router/index.tsx:8. AC1 is satisfied - the page displays the heading correctly.\n- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] shadcn init selections differ (style new-york, baseColor neutral vs default/slate). [components.json:2]\n  - **Resolution:** Actual configuration uses new-york style with neutral base color. This is a valid choice made during shadcn init. Dev Notes updated to reflect actual configuration.\n- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Task 4.4 claims BrowserRouter wrapper but router uses RouterProvider only. [src/router/index.tsx:1]\n  - **Resolution:** RouterProvider with createBrowserRouter is the correct modern React Router v6.4+ data router pattern. Task description used legacy terminology but implementation is correct and preferred.\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] CSS imports tw-animate-css without dependency; dev server likely fails. [src/index.css:4]\n  - **Resolution:** tw-animate-css is provided by tailwindcss-animate plugin. The @import ordering warning is expected behavior for Tailwind v4 + animate plugin integration. Build succeeds (53 modules, 311.79 kB JS, 23.17 kB CSS).\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Story file list doesn't match git changes (only _bmad files modified). [git status]\n  - **Resolution:** Project files are created (untracked), not modified. Git shows only _bmad as modified because project files are new additions awaiting initial commit.\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Story file list claims .eslintrc.cjs but actual config is eslint.config.js. [eslint.config.js:1]\n  - **Resolution:** Story File List corrected to show eslint.config.js (modern ESLint flat config format).\n\n## Dev Notes\n\n### Critical Architecture Rules\n\n1. **Feature Folder Structure (Bulletproof React)**\n   - Every feature folder MUST have `index.ts` that exports its public API\n   - Import ONLY from feature index, NEVER from deep paths\n   ```typescript\n   // CORRECT\n   import { Button } from '@/components/ui';\n\n   // WRONG - Never do this\n   import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\n   ```\n\n2. **Named Exports Only**\n   - NO default exports for components\n   - Always use named exports: `export function ComponentName()`\n\n3. **Naming Conventions**\n   - Components: PascalCase (`NotFoundPage.tsx`)\n   - Functions/variables: camelCase (`handleClick`)\n   - Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE (`MAX_FILE_SIZE`)\n\n### Tailwind CSS v4 Specifics\n\n**CRITICAL: Tailwind v4 has different configuration than v3!**\n\nFor Tailwind v4 with Vite:\n```typescript\n// vite.config.ts\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'\nimport tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'\nimport path from 'path'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: The `resolve.alias` configuration is REQUIRED for @/* imports to work at runtime. Without it, TypeScript will compile but imports will fail in the browser.**\n\n**CSS Setup (v4 syntax):**\n```css\n/* src/index.css */\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n```\n\n**PostCSS Note:** With Tailwind v4's Vite plugin (`@tailwindcss/vite`), a separate `postcss.config.js` is NOT required. The Vite plugin handles CSS processing internally. Only create postcss.config.js if you need additional PostCSS plugins.\n\n**Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui Compatibility:**\nshadcn/ui works with Tailwind v4. When running `npx shadcn@latest init`, it will detect your Tailwind version and configure accordingly. If you encounter issues:\n1. Ensure `@tailwindcss/vite` is installed (not the PostCSS plugin)\n2. Check that `tailwind.config.ts` uses the v4 format\n3. Verify CSS imports use `@import \"tailwindcss\"` not the v3 directives\n\n**Breakpoint Configuration (tailwind.config.ts):**\n```typescript\nexport default {\n  theme: {\n    screens: {\n      'sm': '640px',\n      'md': '768px',\n      'lg': '1024px',\n      'xl': '1280px',\n      '2xl': '1440px',  // MacBook Pro 13\" - primary target\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### shadcn/ui Configuration\n\n**Actual components.json (configured during init):**\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": false,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"tailwind.config.ts\",\n    \"css\": \"src/index.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true,\n    \"prefix\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@/components/ui\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** The new-york style with neutral base color was selected during shadcn init. This provides a clean, modern look consistent with the project's design goals.\n\n**After init, install base components:**\n```bash\nnpx shadcn@latest add button card input\n```\n\n### Folder Structure to Create\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── main.tsx\n├── App.tsx\n├── index.css\n├── vite-env.d.ts\n├── components/\n│   └── ui/\n│       ├── index.ts          # Export all UI components\n│       ├── button.tsx\n│       ├── card.tsx\n│       └── input.tsx\n├── features/\n│   ├── auth/\n│   │   └── index.ts          # Placeholder: export {}\n│   ├── contests/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   ├── categories/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   ├── participants/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   ├── submissions/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   ├── reviews/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   ├── rankings/\n│   │   └── index.ts\n│   └── notifications/\n│       └── index.ts\n├── pages/\n│   ├── index.ts\n│   └── public/\n│       └── NotFoundPage.tsx\n├── contexts/\n│   └── index.ts\n├── lib/\n│   ├── index.ts\n│   └── utils.ts              # cn() helper from shadcn\n├── types/\n│   └── index.ts\n└── router/\n    └── index.tsx\n```\n\n### Environment Variables (.env.example)\n\n```env\n# Supabase (required in Story 1.2)\nVITE_SUPABASE_URL=\nVITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=\n\n# Sentry (required in Story 1.5)\nVITE_SENTRY_DSN=\n\n# Bunny (required in Story 4.4)\n# Note: These are server-side only, never exposed to client\n```\n\n### TypeScript Configuration (tsconfig.json)\n\nEnsure path aliases are configured:\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    },\n    \"strict\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### UX Design Tokens\n\n**Inter Font Setup:**\n```html\n<!-- In index.html -->\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com\">\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.gstatic.com\" crossorigin>\n<link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n**Typography (from UX spec):**\n- Body: 16px, weight 400\n- Headings: 600 weight\n- Line height: 1.5 for body, 1.2-1.3 for headings\n\n### PROJECT_INDEX.md Template\n\n**REQUIRED:** Create this file at project root for LLM agent discoverability.\n\n```markdown\n# Project Index -

(file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

\"master_creator\" },\n  { \"submission_id\": \"uuid\", \"tier\": \"master_creator\" },\n  { \"submission_id\": \"uuid\", \"tier\": \"advanced_producer\" }\n]\n```\n- Index = Rank (0 = 1st place, 1 = 2nd place, etc.)\n- Top 3 indices = Winners displayed on winners page\n- Constraint: Lower-tier submissions cannot rank above higher-tier submissions\n\n**Rating Tiers:**\n\n| Tier | Rating Range |\n|------|--------------|\n| Developing Skills | 1-2 |\n| Emerging Producer | 3-4 |\n| Proficient Creator | 5-6 |\n| Advanced Producer | 7-8 |\n| Master Creator | 9-10 |\n\n## Authentication & Security\n\n**Auth Flows by Role:**\n\n| Role | Method | Implementation |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| Super Admin | Email + Password | Supabase Auth standard login |\n| Judge | Email + Password | Supabase invite → set password on first visit |\n| Participant | Contest Code + Participant Code | Stateless, localStorage, no Supabase account |\n\n**Participant Session Security:**\n- Codes stored in localStorage with `last_activity` timestamp\n- Session expires after **120 minutes** of inactivity\n- Active upload keeps session alive\n- Logout button with reminder for shared devices\n\n**Bunny Upload Security (CRITICAL):**\n- No direct public Bunny endpoints\n- Signed upload URLs generated server-side via Edge Function\n- Validation before URL generation: valid codes, category open, within limits\n- Storage isolation: `/{contest_id}/{category_id}/{participant_code}/{file}`\n- Rate limiting per participant per contest\n\n## API Patterns\n\n| Operation | Approach | Reason |\n|-----------|----------|--------|\n| Read/write contests, categories, submissions | Supabase Client + RLS | Simple CRUD, RLS enforces access |\n| Generate Bunny signed URLs | Edge Function | Secret keys, validation logic |\n| Send email notifications | Edge Function | Brevo API keys, async |\n| Validate participant codes | Edge Function | Rate limiting, session token |\n\n**Row Level Security (RLS):**\n- Admin: Full access to all tables\n- Judge: Read assigned categories + submissions, write reviews/rankings\n- Participant (via Edge Function): Own submissions only\n\n## Frontend Architecture\n\n**State Management:**\n\n| State Type | Solution |\n|------------|----------|\n| Server state | TanStack Query |\n| UI state | React Context |\n| Form state | React Hook Form + Zod |\n\n**Folder Structure: Bulletproof React**\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── features/\n│   ├── auth/\n│   │   ├── api/\n│   │   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── types/\n│   │   └── index.ts

    # Shared types only\n```\n\n**Coding Guideline: Feature Index Files**\n\nEvery feature folder MUST have an `index.ts` that exports its public API.\n\n```typescript\n// features/reviews/index.ts\nexport { RatingScale } from './components/RatingScale';\nexport { useReviews, useSubmitReview } from './hooks/useReviews';\nexport { reviewsApi } from './api/reviewsApi';\nexport type { Review, Rating, Tier } from './types/review.types';\n```\n\n**Import Rule:**\n```typescript\n// ✅ Good\nimport { RatingScale, useReviews } from '@/features/reviews';\n\n// ❌ Bad\nimport { RatingScale } from '@/features/reviews/components/RatingScale';\n```\n\n**For AI Agents:** When exploring or modifying a feature:\n1. FIRST read `features/{feature}/index.ts`\n2. Understand available exports before diving into subfolders\n3. When adding new exports, UPDATE the index.ts\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n**Environments:**\n\n| Environment | Supabase Project | Purpose |\n|-------------|------------------|---------|\n| development | Separate project | Local dev, safe to reset |\n| preview | Production project | PR preview deployments |\n| production | Production project | Live site |\n\n**Environment Variables:**\n\n| Service | Variables |\n|---------|-----------|\n| Supabase | `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` |\n| Bunny Storage | `BUNNY_STORAGE_API_KEY`, `BUNNY_STORAGE_ZONE` |\n| Bunny Stream | `BUNNY_STREAM_API_KEY`, `BUNNY_STREAM_LIBRARY_ID` |\n| Brevo | `BREVO_API_KEY` |\n| Sentry | `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` |\n\n**CI/CD Pipeline:**\n\n| Trigger | Action |\n|---------|--------|\n| Push to `main` | Deploy to production (Vercel) |\n| Push to PR branch | Deploy preview (Vercel) |\n| PR opened | Run lint, type-check, tests (GitHub Actions) |\n\n**Monitoring:**\n\n| Need | Solution |\n|------|----------|\n| Error tracking | Sentry (free tier) |\n| Analytics | Vercel Analytics |\n| Logs | Vercel + Supabase dashboards |\n\n## Updated Initialization Sequence\n\n```bash\n# 1. Create Vite project\nnpm create vite@latest media-education-solutions -- --template react-ts\ncd media-education-solutions\n\n# 2. Install Tailwind\nnpm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite\n\n# 3. Install shadcn/ui\nnpx shadcn@latest init\n\n# 4. Add Supabase\nnpm install @supabase/supabase-js\n\n# 5. Add form handling + data fetching\nnpm install react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers zod @tanstack/react-query\n\n# 6. Add routing\nnpm install react-router-dom\n\n# 7. Add error tracking\nnpm install @sentry/react\n```\n"}}

Follow naming conventions exactly (snake_case DB, camelCase code, PascalCase components)\n2. Import from feature index, not deep paths\n3. Use standardized error codes from `lib/errorCodes.ts`\n4. Use TanStack Query for all server state\n5. Define Zod schemas for all forms\n6. Co-locate tests with source files\n7. Use named exports for components\n8.

Read `PROJECT_INDEX.md` at project root\n2. Understand all features, contexts, and edge functions that exist\n\n**Before modifying a feature:**\n1. Read `features/{feature}/index.ts` completely\n2. Understand all exports before making changes\n3. Check for related tests (co-located with source)\n\n**After adding new files:**\n1. Add export to the relevant `index.ts` immediately\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding new features, contexts, edge functions, or major components\n\n**After removing files:**\n1. Remove export from the relevant `index.ts`\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if removing features or major components\n\n**NEVER:**\n- Create files without adding to index\n- Delete files without removing from index\n- Import from deep paths (always use index exports)\n- Modify files without first reading the feature's index\n\n## Requirements to Structure Mapping\n\n| Feature Area | Primary Location | Related Files |\n|--------------|------------------|---------------|\n| FR1-FR5: Auth | `features/auth/` | `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` |\n| FR6-FR14: Contests | `features/contests/` | `pages/admin/ContestDetailPage.tsx` |\n| FR15-FR19: Participant Codes | `features/participants/` | `pages/admin/ParticipantCodesPage.tsx` |\n| FR20-FR24: Judge Management | `features/auth/`, `features/categories/` | `supabase/functions/send-notification/` |\n| FR25-FR37: Submissions | `features/submissions/` | `supabase/functions/generate-upload-url/` |\n| FR38-FR48: Judging | `features/reviews/`, `features/rankings/` | `pages/judge/ReviewPage.tsx` |\n| FR49-FR53: Admin Override | `features/reviews/`, `features/rankings/` | `pages/admin/SubmissionsPage.tsx` |\n| FR54-FR60: Winners | `features/rankings/` | `pages/public/WinnersPage.tsx` |\n| FR61-FR64: Notifications | `features/notifications/` | `supabase/functions/send-notification/` |\n\n## Architectural Boundaries\n\n**Import Rules:**\n\n| Layer | Can Import From | Cannot Import From |\n|-------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| `pages/` | `features/` (via index), `components/ui/`, `contexts/`, `lib/` | Other pages directly |\n| `features/*/components/` | `components/ui/`, own feature's hooks/types | Other features (use index) |\n| `features/*/hooks/` | Own feature's api/types, `lib/` | Components |\n| `components/ui/` | `lib/utils.ts` only | Features, pages, contexts |\n\n**Data Flow:**\n\n| Data Type | Managed By | Accessed Via |\n|-----------|------------|--------------|\n| Server data | TanStack Query | Feature hooks |\n| Auth state | AuthContext | `useAuth()` |\n| Participant session | ParticipantSessionContext | `useParticipantSession()` |\n| Form data | React Hook Form | Component-local |\n\n## External Integration Points\n\n| Service | Integration File | Purpose |\n|---------|------------------|---------|\n| Supabase Auth | `lib/supabase.ts`, `features/auth/` | Admin/Judge authentication |\n| Supabase DB | `lib/supabase.ts`, feature API files | All data operations |\n| Bunny Stream | `supabase/functions/generate-upload-url/` | Video upload URLs |\n| Bunny Storage | `supabase/functions/generate-upload-url/` | Photo upload URLs |\n| Brevo | `supabase/functions/send-notification/` | Email notifications |\n| Sentry | `lib/sentry.ts` | Error tracking |\n"}}

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The platform serves three distinct user types — each should feel like it was purpose-built for them. Built with a modern, sleek aesthetic inspired by Linear, shadcn/ui, Untitled UI, and Stripe.\n\n## Target Users\n\n| User | Tech Comfort | Primary Emotion | UX Priority |\n|------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| **Jeb (Super Admin)** | High | \"I need control without overwhelm\" | Dashboard clarity, batch operations, zero guesswork |\n| **Judges** | Low | \"Just tell me what to do\" | Pristine simplicity, obvious progress, one-thing-at-a-time |\n| **Participants** | High | \"Will this work? Please work.\" | Upload confidence, deadline assurance, clear confirmation |\n| **T/L/C** | Irrelevant | \"Don't make me log in\" | Email-only interaction |\n\n## Key Design Challenges\n\n1. **The Judge Paradox** — Domain experts who are NOT tech-savvy. Interface must feel so obvious that reluctant judges think \"that was... actually fine\" after their first session. Zero learning curve.\n\n2. **Deadline Crunch Anxiety** — Participants uploading large videos minutes before deadline need absolute confidence. Progress indicators must be butter-smooth, confirmation unmistakable.\n\n3. **Anonymous-to-Revealed Transition** — Judges see only codes during review, but Admin sees everything. Admin view must surface participant data without breaking the mental model of anonymous judging.\n\n4. **Multi-Role, Single Platform** — Three distinct experiences sharing one codebase. Each role should feel purpose-built, not compromised.\n\n## Design Opportunities\n\n1. **Visual Sophistication** — Linear-inspired visual language: subtle gradients, refined typography, generous whitespace, premium \"this feels expensive\" quality across all screens.\n\n2. **Progress-as-Delight** — Judge progress bars that feel satisfying to fill. Subtle dopamine hit at completion with clean completion states.\n\n3. **Upload Confidence Theater** — Make upload experience feel expensive. Smooth progress, processing states, preview before submit, unmistakable confirmation.\n\n4. **Contextual Density** — Admin dashboard can be data-rich; Judge view should be zen-minimal. Same design system, different information density per role.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read this FIRST before any implementation work._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n| Category | Technology | Version |\n|----------|------------|---------|\n| Framework | React | 19 |\n| Build | Vite | 6+ |\n| Language | TypeScript | Strict mode |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS | v4 |\n| Components | shadcn/ui | Latest |\n| Backend | Supabase | Auth + PostgreSQL + Edge Functions |\n| Server State | TanStack Query | Latest |\n| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod | Latest |\n| Routing | React Router DOM | v6+ |\n| Monitoring | Sentry | Latest |\n\n**External Services:**\n- Bunny Stream (video storage/streaming)\n- Bunny Storage (photos/assets)\n- Brevo (transactional email)\n\n---\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### Feature Architecture (MOST IMPORTANT)\n\n**Mandatory Index Files:**\n```typescript\n// Every feature folder MUST have index.ts exporting ALL contents\n// features/submissions/index.ts\n\n// === Components ===\nexport { UploadProgress } from './components/UploadProgress';\nexport { SubmissionCard } from './components/SubmissionCard';\n\n// === Hooks ===\nexport { useSubmissions } from './hooks/useSubmissions';\n\n// === API ===\nexport { submissionsApi } from './api/submissionsApi';\n\n// === Types ===\nexport type { Submission, SubmissionStatus } from './types/submission.types';\n```\n\n**Import Rules:**\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Always import from feature index\nimport { UploadProgress, useSubmissions } from '@/features/submissions';\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Never import from deep paths\nimport { UploadProgress } from '@/features/submissions/components/UploadProgress';\n```\n\n**After Creating Any New File:**\n1. Add export to the feature's `index.ts` immediately\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding new features or major components\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\n| Context | Convention | Example |\n|---------|------------|---------|\n| Database tables | snake_case, plural | `participants`, `contest_codes` |\n| Database columns | snake_case | `created_at`, `contest_id` |\n| TypeScript files | PascalCase (components), camelCase (utils) | `RatingScale.tsx`, `submissionsApi.ts` |\n| Functions/variables | camelCase | `getContests`, `isLoading` |\n| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE | `MAX_FILE_SIZE` |\n| Types/Interfaces | PascalCase | `Contest`, `SubmissionStatus` |\n| Hooks | use + PascalCase | `useContests`, `useFileUpload` |\n\n**Data Transformation:**\n- Database returns `snake_case` → Transform to `camelCase` in API layer\n- Never mix conventions within same layer\n\n### State Management Rules\n\n| State Type | Solution | Location |\n|------------|----------|----------|\n| Server data | TanStack Query | Feature hooks |\n| Form data | React Hook Form | Component-local |\n| Auth state | React Context | `AuthContext` |\n| Participant session | React Context | `ParticipantSessionContext` |\n| Local UI | useState | Component-local |\n\n**Never:**\n- Use useState for server data (use TanStack Query)\n- Create global state for form data\n- Mix state management solutions for same concern\n\n### Authentication Rules\n\n**Three Separate Auth Flows:**\n\n| Role | Method | Implementation |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| Admin | Email + Password | Supabase Auth |\n| Judge | Email + Password | Supabase Auth (invite flow) |\n| Participant | Contest Code + Participant Code | localStorage (NO Supabase account) |\n\n**Participant Session:**\n- Store codes in localStorage with `last_activity` timestamp\n- Expire after **120 minutes** of inactivity\n- Active upload keeps session alive\n- Clear on logout (shared device reminder)\n\n### Bunny Upload Security (CRITICAL)\n\n**Never expose Bunny credentials to client.**\n\n**Upload Flow:**\n1. Client requests signed URL from Edge Function\n2. Edge Function validates: participant codes, category open, within limits\n3. Edge Function returns short-lived signed URL\n4. Client uploads directly to Bunny using signed URL\n\n**Storage Path Pattern:**\n```\n/{contest_id}/{category_id}/{participant_code}/{filename}\n```\n\n### Anonymous Judging Rules\n\n**Judge queries must NEVER access participant PII.**\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ CORRECT - Judge view query\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('id, media_url, participant_id')  // participant_id is UUID, not PII\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Joins to participant data\nconst submissions = await supabase\n  .from('submissions')\n  .select('*, participants(name, organization)')  // EXPOSES PII\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\n**Use Standardized Error Codes:**\n```typescript\nimport { ERROR_CODES } from '@/lib/errorCodes';\n\n// Always use predefined codes\nthrow new AppError(ERROR_CODES.CATEGORY_CLOSED, 'Category deadline has passed');\n```\n\n**Error Codes Available:**\n- `INVALID_CODES`, `SESSION_EXPIRED`, `CONTEST_NOT_FOUND`\n- `CATEGORY_CLOSED`, `SUBMISSION_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`\n- `FILE_TOO_LARGE`, `INVALID_FILE_TYPE`\n- `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `SERVER_ERROR`\n\n### Component Structure\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Imports (React first, then external, then internal)\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui';\nimport { useContests } from '@/features/contests';\n\n// 2. Types (interface for props)\ninterface ContestCardProps {\n  contest: Contest;\n  onSelect: (id: string) => void;\n}\n\n// 3. Component (named export, not default)\nexport function ContestCard({ contest, onSelect }: ContestCardProps) {\n  // hooks first\n  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);\n\n  // handlers\n  const handleClick = () => onSelect(contest.id);\n\n  // render\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Testing Rules\n\n**Co-locate tests with source:**\n```\nfeatures/submissions/components/\n├── UploadProgress.tsx\n├── UploadProgress.test.tsx  ← Same folder\n```\n\n**Test Naming:**\n- Unit tests: `{ComponentName}.test.tsx`\n- Integration tests: `{feature}.integration.test.ts`\n\n### Zod Schema Rules\n\n**Single Source of Truth:**\n```typescript\n// Define schema in types/ folder\n// features/contests/types/contest.schemas.ts\nexport const contestFormSchema = z.object({\n  name: z.string().min(1, 'Required'),\n  contestCode: z.string().length(6, 'Must be 6 digits'),\n});\n\n// Use in form AND API validation\n```\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)\n\n1. **Never import from deep paths** — Always use feature index\n2. **Never use useState for server data** — Use TanStack Query\n3. **Never expose Bunny credentials to client** — Use Edge Functions\n4. **Never join participant PII in judge queries** — Anonymous judging\n5. **Never skip index.ts updates** — Every export must be indexed\n6. **Never mix naming conventions** — snake_case DB, camelCase code\n7. **Never store participant passwords** — Code-only access\n8. **Never use default exports** — Named exports only\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n**Before implementing any feature:**\n1. Read `PROJECT_INDEX.md` at project root\n2. Read the feature's `index.ts` to understand existing exports\n3. Check architecture.md for patterns\n\n**After implementing:**\n1. Update feature's `index.ts` with new exports\n2. Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` if adding major components\n3. Run type-check and lint before committing\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\n---\n\n_Last Updated: 2026-01-10_\n"}}

exports Button, Card, Input from shadcn/ui (minimum starter set)\n\n**Given** lib/index.ts exists\n**When** I check its exports\n**Then** it exports supabase client, cn utility, queryClient\n\n**Requirements:** ARCH12-14, ARCH23-25\n\n---\n\n## Story 1.4: Core UI Components & Patterns\n\nAs a **developer**,\nI want **core UI patterns established (toasts, loading states, error handling)**,\nSo that **all features have consistent user feedback**.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the toast system is configured\n**When** I call `toast.success(\"Message\")`\n**Then** a green toast appears top-right and auto-dismisses after 4 seconds\n\n**Given** the toast system is configured\n**When** I call `toast.error(\"Error message\")`\n**Then** a red toast appears top-right and requires manual dismissal\n\n**Given** lib/errorCodes.ts exists\n**When** I import ERROR_CODES\n**Then** I get typed constants: INVALID_CODES, SESSION_EXPIRED, CONTEST_NOT_FOUND, CATEGORY_CLOSED, FILE_TOO_LARGE, INVALID_FILE_TYPE, VALIDATION_ERROR, SERVER_ERROR\n\n**Given** TanStack Query is configured\n**When** I use a query hook\n**Then** I have access to isLoading, isFetching, error states\n\n**Given** React Hook Form + Zod are configured\n**When** I create a form with validation\n**Then** validation runs on blur and shows inline errors below fields\n\n**Given** a Skeleton component exists\n**When** I render `<Skeleton className=\"h-4 w-full\" />`\n**Then** a loading placeholder animation displays\n\n**Requirements:** ARCH5-6, ARCH19-22, UX20-22, UX24, NFR21\n\n---\n\n## Story 1.5: CI/CD & Environment Configuration\n\nAs a **developer**,\nI want **automated deployments and error tracking configured**,\nSo that **code changes deploy automatically and errors are captured**.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** code is pushed to main branch\n**When** Vercel receives the webhook\n**Then** the application builds and deploys to production URL\n\n**Given** a PR is opened\n**When** Vercel receives the webhook\n**Then** a preview deployment is created with a unique URL\n\n**Given** .env.example exists\n**When** I review it\n**Then** I see all required variables: VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, VITE_SENTRY_DSN\n\n**Given** Sentry is configured\n**When** an unhandled error occurs in production\n**Then** the error is captured and sent to Sentry with stack trace\n\n**Given** the GitHub Actions workflow exists\n**When** a PR is opened\n**Then** lint and type-check run automatically\n\n**Requirements:** ARCH6, ARCH15-17, NFR27\n\n---\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/elias/Desktop/nocodehackers/media-education-solutions/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

{"timestamp":"2026-01-11T21:57:01.793Z","type":"event_msg","payload":{"type":"agent_message","message":"**🔥 CODE REVIEW FINDINGS, NocodeHackers!**\n\n**Story:** `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-1-project-initialization.md`  \n**Git vs Story Discrepancies:** 2 found  \n**Issues Found:** 1 High, 2 Medium, 1 Low\n\n## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES\n- None found.\n\n## 🟡 MEDIUM ISSUES\n- Story File List includes many files not shown as changed in git (e.g., `src/App.tsx`, `src/router/index.tsx`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `components.json`). This is a documentation mismatch in story record vs git reality. Evidence: `git diff --name-only` excludes these files.\n- Story scope is Project Initialization (1.1), but repo contains Supabase artifacts: `supabase/config.toml`, `supabase/migrations/00001_create_profiles.sql`, `src/lib/supabase.ts`, `src/types/supabase.ts`, `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-2-supabase-integration-base-schema.md`. That’s cross-story contamination (1.2+).  \n\n## 🟢 LOW ISSUES\n- `vite.config.js` and `vite.config.ts` both exist; JS file lacks Tailwind plugin while TS file includes it. This can confuse tooling and reviewers. Prefer a single source of truth.

This is a documentation mismatch in story record vs git reality. Evidence: `git diff --name-only` excludes these files.\n- Story scope is Project Initialization (1.1), but repo contains Supabase artifacts: `supabase/config.toml`, `supabase/migrations/00001_create_profiles.sql`, `src/lib/supabase.ts`, `src/types/supabase.ts`, `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-2-supabase-integration-base-schema.md`. That’s cross-story contamination (1.2+).  \n\n## 🟢 LOW ISSUES\n- `vite.config.js` and `vite.config.ts` both exist; JS file lacks Tailwind plugin while TS file includes it. This can confuse tooling and reviewers. Prefer a single source of truth. Evidence: `vite.config.js`, `vite.config.ts`.\n\n## 🔴 HIGH ISSUES\n- `src/index.css` defines a `.dark` theme, but UX spec and Design Direction Decision require light-only mode. This conflicts with UX requirements and risks unintended dark styling (even if unused).

[src/App.tsx:1]\n   111\t  - **Resolution:** DUPLICATE of item below. RouterProvider with createBrowserRouter is the correct modern React Router v6.4+ data router pattern. See router/index.tsx:1.\n   112\t- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] tw-animate-css import without dependency in package.json. [src/index.css:4]\n   113\t  - **Resolution:** DUPLICATE of item below. tailwindcss-animate is installed (package.json:35). The @plugin + @import syntax is correct for Tailwind v4.\n   114\t- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] shadcn/ui design tokens not configured in Tailwind theme. [tailwind.config.ts:3]\n   115\t  - **Resolution:** FALSE POSITIVE. shadcn/ui design tokens ARE configured in src/index.css using Tailwind v4's `@theme inline` block (lines 8-47) and CSS variables (lines 49-116). This is the correct Tailwind v4 pattern - tokens go in CSS, not tailwind.config.ts.\n   116\t- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Story File List claims app files created, but git shows only _bmad changes. [git status]\n   117\t  - **Resolution:** DUPLICATE of item below. Project files are untracked (new additions), not modified. Git shows _bmad as modified because those are existing files that were changed.\n   118\t- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] No test script or tests to validate AC1/AC4. [package.json:6]\n   119\t  - **Resolution:** OUT OF SCOPE. Dev Notes explicitly state: \"Tests will be co-located with source files (added in later stories)\". Story 1.1 focuses on project initialization; test framework setup is planned for a subsequent story.\n   120\t- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Task 1.4 marked done but App heading missing. [src/App.tsx:1]\n   121\t  - **Resolution:** Heading \"Media Education Solutions\" exists in HomePage component at router/index.tsx:8. AC1 is satisfied - the page displays the heading correctly.\n   122\t- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] shadcn init selections differ (style new-york, baseColor neutral vs default/slate). [components.json:2]\n   123\t  - **Resolution:** Actual configuration uses new-york style with neutral base color. This is a valid choice made during shadcn init. Dev Notes updated to reflect actual configuration.\n   124\t- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Task 4.4 claims BrowserRouter wrapper but router uses RouterProvider only. [src/router/index.tsx:1]\n   125\t  - **Resolution:** RouterProvider with createBrowserRouter is the correct modern React Router v6.4+ data router pattern. Task description used legacy terminology but implementation is correct and preferred.\n   126\t- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] CSS imports tw-animate-css without dependency; dev server likely fails. [src/index.css:4]\n   127\t  - **Resolution:** tw-animate-css is provided by tailwindcss-animate plugin. The @import ordering warning is expected behavior for Tailwind v4 + animate plugin integration. Build succeeds (53 modules, 311.79 kB JS, 23.17 kB CSS).\n   128\t- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Story file list doesn't match git changes (only _bmad files modified). [git status]\n   129\t  - **Resolution:** Project files are created (untracked), not modified. Git shows only _bmad as modified because project files are new additions awaiting initial commit.\n   130\t- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Story file list claims .eslintrc.cjs but actual config is eslint.config.js. [eslint.config.js:1]\n   131\t  - **Resolution:** Story File List corrected to show eslint.config.js (modern ESLint flat config format).\n   132\t\n   133\t## Dev Notes\n   134\t\n   135\t### Critical Architecture Rules\n   136\t\n   137\t1. **Feature Folder Structure (Bulletproof React)**\n   138\t   - Every feature folder MUST have `index.ts` that exports its public API\n   139\t   - Import ONLY from feature index, NEVER from deep paths\n   140\t   ```typescript\n   141\t   // CORRECT\n   142\t   import { Button } from '@/components/ui';\n   143\t\n   144\t   // WRONG - Never do this\n   145\t   import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\n   146\t   ```\n   147\t\n   148\t2. **Named Exports Only**\n   149\t   - NO default exports for components\n   150\t   - Always use named exports: `export function ComponentName()`\n"}}
