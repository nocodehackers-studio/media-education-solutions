# Success Criteria

## User Success

| User | Success Indicators |
|------|-------------------|
| **Super Admin (Jeb)** | Manages multiple concurrent contests without proportional admin time increase; Zero manual video distribution to judges; No "did you receive it?" follow-ups — platform handles all notifications |
| **Judges** | Complete reviews without support requests (no emails/calls to Jeb asking "how do I...?"); Interface is self-explanatory; Always know what's pending vs. complete |
| **Participants** | Uploads succeed reliably, even during deadline crunch; Can edit/replace submissions before deadline; Can view feedback after contest finishes |

## Business Success

This is a **validation MVP** — success is measured by Jeb's verdict, not analytics dashboards.

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Platform adoption | Jeb confirms "this replaced my manual process" |
| User self-service | Zero support emails/calls for basic platform usage |
| Technical reliability | Contests complete end-to-end without manual intervention outside the platform |

## Technical Success

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Concurrent uploads | 100+ simultaneous uploads during deadline crunch |
| Upload success rate | 99.5%+ |
| Video streaming | Zero buffering on playback for judges |
| System uptime | 99.9% during contest periods |

## Measurable Outcomes

MVP validation is qualitative, not quantitative:
- Jeb uses the platform for real contests
- Jeb provides feedback on what works and what needs improvement
- No analytics or data tracking in MVP — validation comes from usage and direct feedback
