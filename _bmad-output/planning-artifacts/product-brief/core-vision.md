# Core Vision

## Problem Statement

Media Education Solutions runs photo and video contests for schools, organizations, and events. Currently, managing just 2-3 concurrent contests requires significant manual coordination - creating admin bottlenecks that limit business growth. As participant volumes grow and client demand increases, the manual approach doesn't scale.

## Problem Impact

- **Growth ceiling:** Can't take on more contest clients without drowning in admin work
- **Time drain:** Manual coordination across judges, participants, and media files consumes hours that could go toward business development
- **Scaling wall:** Large participant volumes per contest compound the coordination challenge

## Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Off-the-shelf contest platforms (Submittable, Judgify, etc.) offer rigid workflows and limited customization. Jeb needs full control to:
- Add features on request as his business evolves
- Modify existing functionality to match specific client needs
- Own the platform entirely rather than depending on third-party roadmaps

## Proposed Solution

A custom-built contest management platform featuring:
- **Single Super Admin** managing multiple contests across various clients and events
- **Clear role separation** (Admin / Judges / Participants) with appropriate access controls
- **Automated workflows** from contest creation through winner publication
- **Anonymous judging** to ensure fair evaluation
- **Scalable media handling** for large video (500MB) and photo uploads at volume
- **Extensible architecture** enabling future feature additions without major rewrites

## Key Differentiators

| Differentiator | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| Purpose-built for Jeb's workflow | Not forcing a business into a generic tool's assumptions |
| Full ownership & control | Features added on request, no vendor lock-in |
| Modern scalable stack | Handles growing participant volumes and media files |
| Clean extensible codebase | Future modifications are straightforward, not hacky |
