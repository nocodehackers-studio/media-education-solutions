# Executive Summary

Media Education Solutions is a custom contest management platform built for Media Education Solutions (Jeb) to efficiently manage photo and video contests at scale. The platform replaces time-consuming manual processes with a centralized, automated system - enabling Jeb to grow from managing 2-3 contests to dozens without proportional increases in admin overhead.

Built on a modern, scalable stack (React, Supabase, Bunny Stream/Storage), the platform handles large participant volumes and substantial media files while remaining fully customizable for future feature requests.
