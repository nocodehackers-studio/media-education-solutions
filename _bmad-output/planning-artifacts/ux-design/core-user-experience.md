# Core User Experience

## Defining Experience

The platform serves three distinct user types with fundamentally different core actions:

| Role | Primary Action | Frequency |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| **Super Admin (Jeb)** | Creating/editing contests + monitoring progress + overriding judges | Daily during active contests |
| **Judges** | Rating submissions + writing feedback + ranking top 3 | Session-based (45-min blocks) |
| **Participants** | Uploading creative work + confirming submission | One-time per category (with possible edits) |

The platform must excel at all three, but **Judge review flow** is the make-or-break interaction — frustrated judges create support burden for Jeb, undermining the platform's core value proposition.

## Platform Strategy

**Primary:** Desktop/laptop (all user types)
**Secondary:** Mobile responsive (same interface, fluid adaptation)

- No separate mobile-specific interfaces or touch-optimized variants
- Responsive design ensures usability across screen sizes
- Participants may occasionally submit from mobile (CapCut editors, etc.)
- Judges may review on-the-go in limited scenarios
- Admin workflows assume full keyboard/mouse environment

## Effortless Interactions

| Role | Effortless Moment | Design Implication |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Jeb** | "How is this contest doing?" | Dashboard answers in one glance — no clicks required |
| **Judges** | "What do I review next?" | Obvious next action, never ambiguous |
| **Participants** | "Did my upload work?" | Unmistakable confirmation, no uncertainty |

## Critical Success Moments

1. **Upload Completion** — Sofia at 11:51 PM must feel absolute certainty her submission succeeded
2. **Judge First Session** — Marcus's first 10 minutes determine if he'll finish or abandon
3. **Contest Launch** — Jeb publishing a contest and seeing codes generate instantly
4. **Deadline Crunch** — 100+ simultaneous uploads completing without failure

## Experience Principles

1. **Clarity Over Cleverness** — Every screen answers "what do I do here?" in under 3 seconds
2. **Confidence at Every Step** — Users always know: Did it work? What's next? Am I done?
3. **Desktop-First, Responsive Always** — Optimize for laptop workflows, never break on mobile
4. **Reliability is UX** — Technical performance IS the user experience
5. **Role-Appropriate Density** — Same design system, right information density per context
