# Future Work & Deferred Items

**Project:** media-education-solutions
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-12

## Purpose
This document tracks valuable features, improvements, and technical debt discovered during implementation that are **out of scope** for current stories/epics but should be addressed in future work.

---

## How to Use This Document

### When to Add Items
- Feature is valuable but not required for current acceptance criteria
- Implementation would significantly delay story completion
- Nice-to-have vs must-have features
- Technical debt or optimization opportunities discovered
- Security/performance improvements that aren't blocking

### When NOT to Add Items
- Required for current acceptance criteria
- Bug that breaks existing functionality
- Needed for story to work properly
- Blocking issue (use correct-course workflow instead)

### Review Cadence
- **During Story Work:** Add items as discovered
- **During Epic Retrospective:** Review and prioritize epic-specific items
- **During Sprint Planning:** Promote high-priority items to new stories
